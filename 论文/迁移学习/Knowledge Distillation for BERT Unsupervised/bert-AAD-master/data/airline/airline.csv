Flight from London to Miami then Miami to La Paz. By far the most disappointing flight we have had. The cabin crew were unbelievably rude disinterested and unhelpful. We've had much better service with budget airlines. Thought it was ridiculous that people could reserve seats up to one year in advance. Our flights were booked by a tour company so we were unaware of this until a few days before and therefore left with disappointing seats on the way out to our honeymoon destination. Will not fly with American Airlines again.,0
ICN-BKK-KUL. First time flying with Thai Airways and via Bangkok. Check-in at ICN was smooth and fast. The ICN to BKK was quite empty and had a row to myself. The entertainment system was good but B772 ICN-BKK screen was smaller than the new A330 BKK to KUL. The food on both sector were great one of the best. Service was great. Plenty of drink rounds by the cabin crews. The only problem was walking on the tarmac on both flight at BKK. Overall it was a pleasant journey and would fly with Thai airways again in the future.,1
Ottawa to Iqaluit (formally know as Frobisher Bay) in Canada?s Arctic. First time flying with Canadian North. Checked in at the Ottawa airport for the morning flight. The gate was located in the new terminal. Flight was on a 737 with about 60 seats. Asked the flight attendant where the rest of the seats were? Was informed that the airplane was in a ?combi mode??and had freight in the forward half of the plane. She also explained that's why we had to board stairs at the back because the airbridge can not be used. Flight took just under 3 hours. Outstanding service. From a hot breakfast hot towels and coffee with Irish cream all included in the fare. Return back to Ottawa 2 days later with the same great services. Meal this time was an Arctic Char with free wine and another coffee and Irish cream. There was no entertainment consoles on board but it did not seem to mater as there were no bad jokes by the flight attendants either. Will fly with them again!,0
Flight BI 874 KUL-BWN Feb 17 2013. No 'welcome' 'thank you' or 'goodbye'. No newspapers at all. No entertainment. No coffee / tea in my section. Only one choice of meal (beef) which I declined and wasn't offered as much as a packet of peanuts instead. Crew apathetic and struggling with basic English. I appreciate it is Chinese New Year season but surely that has been factored into the price of the ticket (RM1700+). I used to think about bringing my family to Brunei on vacation (as opposed to just business). After this flight I'm afraid it's not going to happen.,0
Flew LHR-MIA in WT+. Seats 13E and 13F on 747. It was very comfortable for a day flight and after a light meal I managed to get around 5 hours of sleep. Recline is good and leg room ok for a person of my height 5ft 10in. Food was ok and would have liked to eat my partners sticky toffee pudding because mine went down too well! We were off the plane first at MIA before First and club which was rather nifty. Good experience.,1
"AMS-OPO (TP651 on 25/7/2013) and OPO-AMS (TP652 on 29/7/2013). Inbound flight delayed 1hr 35mins for a 2hr 38mins flight. Outbound flight delayed 30 minutes. Delays are constant on this route. The last 10 flights I flew on this route were all delayed. The explanation was always the same: ""late arrival of the aircraft"" which really is no explanation whatsoever as to say that the flight is late because the aircraft is late amounts to say nothing at all. The delays led to the loss of takeoff/landing slots and/or to the allocation of the farthest takeoff/landing runaway in Schiphol which adds to the delays and is frustrating to the passengers. Priority luggage at the arrival of the aircraft in Amsterdam was delivered last compounding the delay. Boarding was chaotic with everyone boarding simultaneously and queues not being respected both in OPO and AMS. Aircraft on this route (Fokker-100) are old and outdated. TAP Portugal is expensive (flight costs are those of a premium airline while the service is certainly not) inefficient and its on-time performance is appalling. Although the food is decent in the business cabin the service is nothing special with attitude shown from both the cabin crew and the handling staff. It is dangerously placed in an airline limbo: its service is slightly better than a low cost - food/drinks and newspapers are provided - but its cost is that of a premium airline. However delays are a constant. All in all it would not be a sustainable airline if it did not have the advantage of the de-facto monopoly in certain routes. Not recommended.",0
Samara-Prague-Paris and Samara-Prague-Barcelona. 2 baggage losses simply outrageous - when I was traveling to Paris I was supposed to stay there for 6 months and when they lost my baggage I had only the clothes that were actually on me at the moment. I had my baggage back only 2 weeks after. Don't expect the representatives to react to your claims you're going to be politely ignored. Now I'm in Barcelona and was supposed to go to the Pyrenees to ski but they lost my baggage again and all my sportswear is in there. It may seem like good value but you risk too much and if they lose your baggage you're gonna pay the difference you'd pay for a flight with a different airline. So as you might guess I do not recommend this airline.,0
"YYZ-YYC. TV worked properly for a change managed to get most of the channels. Crew seemed disinterested in doing their work which is a little unusual for Westjet. I do have to say though I can't stand their seats. I am only 5'9"" but the seat ends about half way down my thigh. There is no support and after 4+ hours a little tiring. Don't think I would fly them long distances.",1
Luton to Budapest. Flight supposed to be 2025 got to gate to embark and they called a 2 hour delay as problem with plane. Estimated time for flight in the end was 11.00am the next day and I doubt whether that happened. Myself and a lot of others decided not to fly and it took over an hour to get our bags back off plane. Decided to book with easyjet. I lost 1nights accommodation 1 taxi transfer and too tired to do anything as by the time I arrived in Budapest just wanted to sleep so wasted day. Airport staff at Menzies were unhelpful (police were even called as a lot or irate people). Tiny prices but pathetic service will never fly Wizz Air again.,0
BNE-HVB-BNE in Dash 8 300 and Q400 aircraft excellent flights. I would happily fly QantasLink all around Australia if I could. Superb service for short flights which were on-time despite poor weather. Excellent wine (free) on these short flights. Often the best service on Qantas family of airlines is the smaller internal flights with young and enthusiastic staff of QantasLink - they have an entirely better attitude compared with many of their long-serving senior colleagues on the long-haul services of Qantas.,1
Flew Sydney to Manchester return Business Class. New Business Class seats are very good.. I got the old seat from AUH-SYD and you can definitely see the improvement. Food was good. Other airlines do offer a bigger Menu. Lounge in Terminal 3 AUH very disappointing too small and at Peak times standing room only. Etihad's main competition Emirates offer a better overall product. Etihad are trying to keep up with Emirates. They are trying to grow very quickly but missing some of the simple little things that make a great airline such as Singapore or Emirates.,0
TCX2026 Manchester to Paphos on 16 October 2012 delayed 8 hours and the handling of passenger welfare was unacceptable. Flight due to depart at 0700 hrs. On checking in at 0545 we were advised it was still 0900 for a technical problem. Only update was via the departures board which pushed back to 0930 then further information at 1000. A tannoy announced delay until 1400hrs and to collect a Â£10 refreshment voucher in a queue that took 1 hour. Thomson flight drafted in as replacement - departure now posted at 1430. As boarding given letter of explanation found out that the meal we had prepaid for was not available via Thomson. Letter stated we would be refunded flight meal money on return to UK but now have discovered we have to write in to claim it back. Took off at 1505.,0
Istanbul IST to Munich airport on March 25th at 6.25 am and the flight left on time and arrived early. The flight attendants were very friendly and the airline was very punctual. The return flight from Munich to Istanbul was just as good as well. Would fly Lufthansa again.,1
SFO-Beijing-BKK flight in June 2013 and the service was mediocre. An old aircraft with 60-70 people sharing one big TV monitor. When we first got onboard it was very hot in the cabin the stewardess said its normal and once we were flying the temperature would cool down. The flight was late so I missed my connecting flight. I was placed into an airport hotel. On the last flight coming home there was water dropping from the overhead bin so the stewardess put tissues and napkins in between the gaps.,0
Weipa-Cairns. I could hardly believe the comments below about this Qantas Link route. I have been travelling this route regularly in the past year. It is usually late and often by hours. When delays occur there is no information available at Weipa airport and the Qantas call centre cannot tell you what is happening.,0
MNL-BKK-MNL. Flew last summer on an A340. interior are old entertainment is poor (drop down tv monitor only) boarding is delayed by 15 min only (no problem) take off is again delayed by 10 min (not fault of the airline). Flight crew robotic (not consistent with their domestic crew). Return flight is same crew are robotic and not warm but they are professional. PR lags behind other Asian competitor. Will fly them again maybe after rehabilitation is finished.,1
Aug 23 from JFK to TXL and again on Sep 03 from TXL to JFK. Our Eastbound take-off was delayed 2.25 hours due to ??mechanical difficulties but the flight going back to JFK arrived a few minutes early. AB has a problem with space which is in short supply. I am average height and weight yet I could not walk in the aisles without turning sideways. A passenger in front me on the Eastbound flight reclined her seat and made the space issue more critical. Seats are narrow and seat belts date back to 1968. Staff are friendly and polite but refuse to recognize that some passengers do not understand German. Food quality surpassed my expectations saluting the American Cuisine on the Eastbound portion. The meal quality on the Westbound portion surpassed that of Business Class food on other carriers!,0
Rude staff at airport in Rome along with the staff at the Alitalia lounge in Rome. My husband needs wheelchair assistance and was treated as though he was a burden unlike other airlines who were very kind and helpful. Absolutely horrible service. Washroom was what you'd expect at a dirty gas station. Food - very poor. Never again.,0
I took CZ307 on the 4th. Due to the thunderstorm in Guangzhou our flight was delayed. The announcements were made in time and the flight attendant served us drinks. About 1.5 hrs later we took off. The meal was served soon after we were airborne the choice were limited and by the time they get to my row I didn't even have an option. However the flight attendant promised to let me choose first for the second meal. I wouldn't say the food was delicious but it's okay for what I paid for the ticket. Seat was okay but my touch screen didn't work so I had to use the control button which makes no sense at all it took me while to work that out. Toilets were cleaned promptly. I would say it was a good flight but mostly for the service. The meal could improved a bit and entertainment could be better. Would recommend it.,1
They are cheap and they are cheap for a reason! - 2 stories of incompetence - First my brother took the LGW to BKK economy return in May 2004. Outbound no problem. Return flight they dumped all the passengers in the middle of the desert (Dubai) and abandoned the flight due to supposed technical failure but later we discovered they had missed their landing slot at Gatwick. Absolute chaos at Dubai airport and the one lady Phuket airline staff deserted her post and left 300+ passengers stranded. All the Phuket Airlines officials did a runner! No explanations given! After 5 hours of irate passengers spitting nails ??an Emirates official grasped the nettle and re- scheduled everybody back to Heathrow or Gatwick on Emirates flights. My brother was delayed around 8 hours. Story no. 2 - thinking maybe my brother had a ?one off experience??I flew out same route economy class Â£456 LGW to BKK in August. Outbound no problem decent flight with average service. Return flight I re-confirmed my flight 72 hours prior with booking reference. Reached BKK airport 3 hours before departure and 3 queues were about 50 metres long already! - and hardly moving. It took an amazing 3 and half hours to eventually reach the desk as the staff were spending 80% of their time on walkie talkies. By the time I reached the desk I was told by the check in girl that the flight was overbooked and I couldn?t fly that day! ??Charming! It?s now 2.30 am I am dog tired and no Phuket flights for 3 days! ??They transferred about 8 of us to a nice hotel and put us on standby for BA/Quantas. Yes ?standby??at peak holiday season! ??no guarantee of getting home for 3 days ... lucky B.A. had a seat the next night back to Heathrow (not LGW) making my home train ticket invalid to Sheffield. I complained by email to Phuket Airlines (their website is useless). It appears that standby passengers were let onto our flight whilst valid ticket holders like myself were denied access. No reply by email but did eventually receive a letter reply 3 months later. A long convoluted generalised statement about overbooking problems and didn?t address the real issues. If you want to save money and take a risk go ahead and book - but for me Phuket Airlines nay more!,0
"FRA-LHR on A319, We sat on the plane at the gate for almost 40 minutes due to one runway closed, no drinks offered. No veg meal for my wife, Empty bottle under the middle seat tray. Landed allegedly almost on time due to the excessive time scheduled for the leg.",0
90mn delay for the flight BCN Paris Orly. Chaotic boarding very noisy passengers crew did not really care. Old B737-800 dirty. Not even a glass of water to apologise. Never again.,0
"My company and I mostly travel on SAS in the Nordic region. Heading up our company in this region I wanted to try out the highly advertised Dreamliner to and from New York. Traveling to NY from CPH was fantastic. I had booked Premium class. Going to NY I enjoyed the great seats and also quite good service. Norwegian had the return flight operated by ""Titan Airways"" a budget carrier from the UK. With an all coach seating arrangement. Norwegian did not inform us despite their website saying that if a different plane is used the customer will get informed prior to the flight. The check in people at JFK said this other plane had also premium seats. So do did the gate crew. All lies. One of my fellow travelers noticed that on his reservation document from 1 week before the trip it already said ""Titan Airways operated"" meaning that Norwegian already knew before the outbound trip that the return flight would not be the Dreamliner. Norwegian however sold us Premium tickets for both Outbound and inbound flight. I have traveled a lot throughout my career but have never seen airline just advertising one product but selling another without telling the customer. Not at the time of buying nor at the time of check-in. Besides the fact that the premium class customers had to travel unexpectedly in a very tight coach seat they now also need to go through the hassle of claiming money back. It is service of the very worst kind. Norwegian doesn't have enough Dreamliners to accommodate all the Dreamliner routes they advertise and sell.",0
I flew HND to CDG on the new Business Class. The seat is far better. Service and food always good. One small issue: new entertainment system takes at least 20 minutes to understand unless you are a specialist. Typically French: not intuitive at all complex and could have been much better if tested on real customers. Once you understand how to use it one must admit the offer is great. One big problem: they have only two toilets for business class (65 seats!) ! They had three before! Surprise surprise everybody waits in line for ages! This is a terrible mistake they made! The funny thing is that they want to upscale!,0
I recently flew to London on SAA the most horrendous and stressful experience. I arrived at Johannesburg airport 3.5 hours before take off and went straight to the check-in desk. The queue was already substantial - only one check in desk open for international passengers it took me two hours to check in. I complained to two senior personnel both times they were rude and unhelpful. When I arrived at passport control there was a similar problem. I eventually got to the plane 10 minutes before we were due to take off. We then had to wait as a passenger did not arrive and their luggage had to be removed I realise that was not SAA?s fault but more was to follow. The next delay was due to missing paper work when that eventually arrived we started to taxi to the runway only to stop. We were told there was a problem with one of the engines and had to be towed back to the docking bay to wait for repairs. Running 1.5 hours late we eventually left but the problems did not stop. Early the next morning I called a stewardess as the toilets were not flushing the captain announced some time later that everyone had to use the bathroom as they were going to be locked the mechanism wasn?t working properly. The return trip wasn?t much better the seats very extremely cramped I dropped my book and due to the seat in front being in a reclining position I couldn?t bend down and pick it up. My daughter?s seat wouldn?t recline at all so we had to take it in turns sitting there.,0
OKC to ATL then ATL to TPA MD 80 from OKC to ATL then twin engined wide body Boeing from ATL to TPA. Seats on both flights were uncomfortable with minimal recline. The headrest pushes my head forward making it difficult for me to nap. On both flights I forgot to bring my seat to the upright position for landing. The FAs didn't notice or might have figured it didn't make any difference. I would not pay to fly Delta in economy or EC on account of the uncomfortable seats. I traveled on a free ticket purchased by my spouse with FF miles so I gave Delta three stars for Value for Money. Food for purchase but items that appealed to me weren't available. The FAs were courteous the flight uneventful. However Delta is my least-favorite airline.,0
"Upon arriving at Myrtle Beach airport my Spirit flight was still scheduled and ""on time"" per the Spirit flight tracker on their website. I had pre-printed my boarding pass so I continued through security. After going through security I saw on the flight board that my Spirit flight had been canceled. When I approached the gate where my flight should have been starting to board there was no one there. Not even a Spirit employee who could answer my question where is the plane and why is it canceled? I had to go back to the check-in desk to see what was going on. Everyone on that flight was standing in line as well waiting to see when the next plane would be there. After waiting for 45 minutes to talk to a customer service rep I was told that the next flight available would not be for 2 days. I asked why it was abruptly canceled and they kept saying ""weather"". Even though it was sunny in both my departing city and arrival city. I ended up canceling my flight with Spirit and getting my money back. I booked my flight home with another airlines that could get me home the next day. I will never fly Spirit again and I strongly advise anyone from flying with this company. They do not have reasoning for their random canceled flights and extreme delays in re-booking.",0
I had booked a return trip from LGW to WHK - about 2 weeks before my scheduled departure from Gatwick I stumbled across information (by chance!) on the internet that Air Namibia had axed all its flights from Gatwick. They never informed me of it at all (later I found out it was because I had booked directly with the airline on its website rather than with a travel agent. People who booked directly with the airline received no information apparently). So I phoned their representatives (who were still active in London). The agent who took my call was very helpful though - she rescheduled my flight without issues with BA via Frankfurt. She had also assured me that I could check my bags straight through from Heathrow to Windhoek. Of course this ended up not being the case. The lady at the BA counter at Heathrow knew of no such cooperation with Air Namibia. She said I had to re-check the bags in at Frankfurt. I didn't mind though. Otherwise my flights were on time and I got to Windhoek without any other hassle. The return journey was flawless - bags checked through all the way to Heathrow from Windhoek via Frankfurt. I would fly them again.,1
I fly regularly with Jet2 to Murcia san Javier as they are the only company to fly from Edinburgh. On this trip the return flight was delayed by and hour which wasn't too bad. I always find Jet2 staff to be nice and helpful and have no real complaints other than their aircraft's are so old. I have been on and had gaps in the ceiling stuffed with kitchen paper to catch the drips of condensation. As a bit of a nervous flyer it doesn't fill me with joy when I see these things and puts me off flying with them.,0
The fleets are new comfy. Flew Narita-Dubai-Munich and Rome-Narita. Always wanted to try A380. The FA's were awful. On one flight the table was dirty. I took 4 flights in total and every time I experienced something horrible. Firstly they didn't give me the bread and I had to ask 2 times for it next I had to wait over 15 mins to receive my main dish. I asked for water that I didn't receive. This is the worst airline service I have experienced so far.,0
We booked to go East Midlands to Palma. A few days before I had an email to say travelling with Air Italy a small relatively new company. We had the same seats both ways. We were half an hour late leaving. In our seats we noticed repairs sticky tape and ripped armrests. Unfortunately we were on the same plane home - we recognised the sticky tape! My husband's lunch served at 12.30 was the same as the breakfast served on the way out!,0
Very impressed flew IAE to SAL and BOG during March. New planes friendly and smiling staff flights on time a nice change to US airlines and their flight attendants!,1
PEK-ZRH on A343. Was probably the best long-haul flight I've experienced. Everything was just perfect. Fortunately that day I flew the load factor was incredibly low so there was a lot of room for all passengers. AVOD is oldish but still can make a good service. Swiss is my European No.1 for long-haul flights.,1
Attentive and courteous cabin crew always happy to help and make the journey as pleasant as possible. 787 Dreamliner was great very quiet and lots of space - everything brand new. Fully flat beds in business which is a must but surprising how many tier 2 airlines (KLM Air France etc) don't have this. Great price and direct to Guangzhou from UK. Arrived early.,1
"Still waiting to board a flight that was supposed to leave an hour ago. All we have been told by the attendants is ""we are still waiting for more information, we can't tell you anything"". We will now miss the last ferry to Hvar and have nowhere to stay when we get to Split. ",0
My friend and I travelled back from Dalaman and found poor customer service delivery. Staff were unsmiling and off-hand initially we put this down to the language barrier and cultural differences. I had fallen asleep on this evening/night flight and as sitting on the outer seats ensured I positioned myself away from the passageway so as not to be bumped by other passengers. I was woken up by one the stewardesses pushing her serving trolley and knocking into my shoulder. On her way back she did it again. However as I was awake this time I asked pointed it out that I had been barged into the stewardess just looked blankly at me in an intimidating manner. Then smiling sarcastically apologised. Later when asking to purchase milk for my 4 year old daughter I was told that they had no milk no apology no smile and no offer of an alternative. Overall the staff serving the back of the plane were surly and rude.,0
My husband and I flew with Small Planet last year to Greece. Never heard of them before. Flight was an hour late taking off but to be honest wasn't that much of a problem - once on flight (we took our own food and drink - so couldn't mark them on food) everyone was friendly the plane was new and flight was good. I hate flying and have to know as much about airline I am travelling with and even then am really scared. This year we are flying with them again - and although still scared of flying I know the cabin crew will be once again as helpful as before. The only reason I fly is to have a holiday abroad otherwise I wouldn't but having said that I couldn't fault the cabin crew one bit they were all very friendly polite and helpful.,1
We flew Mexico to Panama as a connection to San Juan. Check in was fast. The food was surprisingly good. The staff is very friendly. I highly recommend Copa Airlines.,1
"PVG-HKG - August 13 2013. I'm a Marco Polo member but have never flown with Dragonair only CX also on regional flights. This time I had to choose Dragonair the aircraft an A320 had one of the worst seats I have experienced there were no space for legs it was just like flying a budget airline. The only good thing was that arriving at the airport pretty early the guy at the check in could put me in the first flight leaving and the flight itself was delayed ""only"" of one hour a sort of miracle in Chinese skies.",0
I first flew Cathay in 2011 to China which was a very good experience in all areas (service catering entertainment etc) however I flew Cathay again in 2014 to USA and Canada and was very shocked at how the quality of their service catering and entertainment had declined in a matter of 3 years. The staff who were previously helpful are now unfriendly lazy and unhelpful and the catering is atrocious. The food is poor quality and has little or no taste and rightly said by another reviewer they somehow no longer provide salt and pepper! I understand times are tough with certain airlines but you wouldn't expect them to skim on basic condiments. The entertainment system has limited options and sadly I think the overall passenger experience in economy has gone downhill. Don't think Cathay will be my first choice in future.,0
"IAD to VIE in business class on board a B777. An excellent flight. Service and the food prepared by the ""Flying Chef"" were superb. Excellent cabin crew. Very comfortable lie flat seats. Only negative was the cabin was too warm which made it difficult to sleep. We would definitely fly on Austrian again.",1
EWR-BOM-AMD. Flight was supposed to depart on 3 July 2014 I flew on 5th July. Everything went well until take off there was a problem with the air-conditioning which was not resolved at all. After 4.5 hours we were told to get off the plane. After getting our baggage we were told to stand in a queue for 40 mins to get hotel vouchers and after getting the voucher I was waited for the hotel transportation for 3 hours. We were 54 passengers and there was only 1 bus which could carry 34 passengers. Back to the airport for 11 am next day told to stand in line for another flight which was at 4 pm on 4 July 2014. After standing in line for 4 hours I was told the flight was full and another was scheduled for 8. Boarded the flight and after 2 hrs we were told that there was problem with the engine and it took them another 4 hours to decide that we had to get off the plane again another motel was given. Spoke to a manager of Air India and they got me on 5th July's AI 190 EWR-BOM-AMD flight. Finally on 5th July I arrived home 72 hours late. I have decided not to fly Air India in the future.,0
"Flights on time. Baggage handling was fine this time around. Snacks were provided. Toilets were clean, overall inflight experience was fine, if not better than my previous flights with American Airlines/US Airways. I would fly with this carrier again.",1
Economy round-trip from SIN-ARN via Bangkok. Found their service to be patchy: it was great on TG 410 (SIN-BKK) and TG 403 (BKK-SIN) acceptable on TG 961 (ARN-BKK) and lukewarm on TG 960 (BKK-ARN). I didn't like that they didn't have kid-sized headphones for IFE - my tiny 5-year old held hers up to her ears for the whole journey. On the ARN-BKK and BKK-SIN legs there was not much difference between my special meal and the kids' meals. They also did not give the kids any 'goody bags' except for the BKK-SIN leg where they presented my kids with lunchboxes filled with snacks. FAs didn't do their rounds much during the night portion of the BKK-ARN leg they did it more frequently during the ARN-BKK leg though they ran out of the snacks as many passengers were peckish during the night (between dinner and breakfast service). On the BKK-SIN route we got to travel in a new plane and were impressed.,1
We will never fly US Airways again after this experience. The first three legs of our journey were OK - average service but on-time arrivals but the last leg was a nightmare. Our flight was cancelled after a 4-hour delay and while cancellations happen to all airlines the way US Airways handled this one was appalling. Gate agents could not operate their own ticketing system to rebook passengers baggage was delivered two hours late and to a carousel in a different terminal and US Airways employees had no idea what was going on and were generally indifferent to passenger needs. We were traveling with an infant yet were given a hotel 15 minutes away when there was another hotel connected to the airport that other families received. Overall just a complete disaster in terms of customer service.,0
I was flying from Vancouver to Fort St. John with my 3 year old son and our plane was delayed 8 hours. I was stressed about having to be stuck there that long with nowhere to nap or entertain my son. The agent booked us a room (on WestJet) for the day at the hotel airport where I was able to bath and nap him. They also gave us food vouchers for the whole day. A few days later I received an e-mail apology with 20% off our next flights. I must say this is the best customer service I have seen. They turned what could have been a horrible stressful day into a fun day at the airport for my son and stress free for me. I will fly WestJet anytime I can. I highly recommend.,1
Goa-Mumbai-Vadodara Domestic Flight. The food on both flights was below average and service in general poor. Flight was on time and baggage wait acceptable. Needs a lot of improvement to become an international carrier. It does not make sense to pay a full fare against the low cost domestic carriers.,0
TG931 Paris - Bangkok A380 Business Seat 19K. Departed on time and Business cabin was around 75% occupied. Very good FAs on this flight service was well organized and the crew were trying hard to please the passengers. A word of warning to fellow travelers flying Thai A380s avoid seats 24B and 24J these seats are right opposite the toilet doors and I have observed many complaints from fellow passengers wanting to move from these seats.,1
I had the best transatlantic flight experience. This is due largely to Boeing 787 aircraft. Their Premium Economy surpasses any other Premium Economy class that I have flown on other airlines. Most charge almost double for the same service. I hope Norwegian eventually figures out that if they added lie-down flat business class seats they would be even more competitive. I used Norwegian on a return flight from JFK-LGW and and back. ,1
Manchester-Newark-Grand Rapids. Online check-in did not work. B757-200 old noisy airplane for long haul. Inefficient scruffy looking rude staff. Alcoholic drinks charged for. Horrible sub-standard meals. US immigration staff at Newark airport nice. Flight from Newark to Grand Rapids delayed due to tech fault. Only soft drinks served on 2 hour flight. Overall terrible experience.,0
NYU to RGN. First told flight would not be direct then 1 hour delay then flight cancelled. They book us on the evening flight with another airline. Story of operational issues with plane seemed less than truthful. Airline needs to improve reliability if they wish to serve and attract international passengers. Airline website lacks any real time flight status. At checking everything done with paper and pen. I noticed a number of passengers whose reservations they could not find. Good idea to print out receipt when you book and have it with you. Staff were helpful as they could be under the circumstances.,0
"I add this old comment out of interest to others. LHR to Sao Paulo Sao P to Salvador. Just a few minutes before scheduled take off - flight delayed by 14 hours! (gone tech). I risked loosing my sailing holiday. The TAM functionaire accompanied and assisted me to get my baggage off the plane and spent a lot of time and effort trying to help me. I say she went well beyond the call of duty! (This flight was delayed not by a fault of TAM but of BA who ""stole"" their slot!) Arriving at SP they tried to organise hotels for all the passengers. Returning to LHR plane half empty - we all got to stretch out - great sleep! the first and last time that will happen!!! All in all warmly recommend TAM - it is important to know the actual cause of the problem. (This is nearly always gross overcrowding both on the ground and in the air).",1
I have flown 3 times a year with Egyptair from LHR to CAI then on the SSH and all the flights have been excellent except on the one occasion when my suitcase was not on the CAI/SSH leg. The Friday 10.30pm flight suits me and the couple of hours transit in Cairo is a small price to pay when you can arrive at SSH at 9.00am and have the whole day there. The food and drinks are fine why people especially British are expecting alcohol when it is a Muslim airline is beyond me and surely they can manage without a drink for a few hours. Price wise they often work out cheaper than Easyjet and you can take 46kg of luggage in economy without having to pay for it not to mention not having to pay for food drinks having the pleasure of IFE and flights that operate daily and at really convenient times.,1
NRT-SVO-IST and BEG-SVO-NRT. NRT-SVO(333) Check-in was smooth. Lounge at NRT (Delta) was comfortable. Cabin was clean. Seat was comfortable. CAs were friendly. Food was very good. it was a nice flight. SVO-IST(321) 1 hour delay. It's not bad. BEG-SVO (320) Check in started 2 hours before the flight. Lounge was good. CAs were friendly. Food was good. SVO-NRT(333) Connection was smooth. Newest 333's seat was very comfortable for sleep. Not sliding down. Cabin was clean. CAs were very friendly. Food was excellent. It was a quite nice flight. Problem was logistics at the airport.,1
LGW-SKG roundtrip. Very good value for money. On time flights nice check-in area at Gatwick airport clean and modern aircraft reasonable prices for luggage friendly website easy to book a flight.,1
Flew from Toronto to San Jose CR via Houston. Trying to leave YYZ Air Canada could not provide more than one person at the gate and then did not have a flight crew available. The delays were not notified in advance and we could not cancel hotel reservations. We missed connecting flight in Houston but were informed that United was holding flight for us. When we arrived at United counter they informed us that they told AC that flight was not held so we returned to AC counter only to find it closed. We then went looking for baggage and were told that the baggage was never included on flight out and then hung up on us. We have now spent five days waiting for baggage with no information provided to us or partner carriers very unusual. Typical response is apology with no further information or update nor return call of any sort. Complete incompetence exhibited by AC throughout this process and direct and outright lies in regards to continued correspondence with the firm. I will never fly with this airline again.,0
Return trip from Singapore to Kolkata (India). Silent (no audio) entertainment system narrow seats food was not good missed luggage (though I had about 15 hrs layover/connecting time at Changi). Chaotic customer service at Kolkata regarding missed luggage. I would not recommend SilkAir to anyone!,0
DY7042 FLL-CPH June 15th 2014. DY7041 CPH-FLL July 9 2014. I think the dreamliner was a good travel experience flying from Fort Lauderdale to Copenhagen despite a 1 hour delay in take off. The return from Copenhagen to Fort Lauderdale with a 787 was less of a pleasant experience however the worst was arriving at Fort Lauderdale airport. Horrendous in many ways confusing and tiny passport hall even worse was the baggage hall no information total confusion and a line to customs that wrapped around the baggage hall twice yes twice! The ground personal I must say was nicer than the rest of the experience. Unfortunately never again not due to the flying experience but the arrival experience.,0
Adelaide-Kuala Lumpur-Beijing. Happy with the Business Class product offered by Malaysia Airlines but if this airline wants to compete with the new player on the block in Adelaide Air Asia then clean the fuselages of your aeroplanes! A clean white Air Asia A330 (yes in all white colour) pulling up alongside Malaysia's sooty white fuselage is not a good look. Also noticed a dirty A330 at KL so ours was not a one off. Also hoping Business Class lounge at KL will be re-opened soon. One small gripe about food service lunch out of Adelaide was served at 11.30am after a 10 am departure. Was too soon. Two years ago a light breakfast was served with lunch later in the flight. Maybe a cost cutting exercise?,1
I'm still at Bangkok airport waiting for my connecting flight  having just stepped off my economy Heathrow - Bangkok flight. Given some of the reviews on here I have to be honest - I was a little worried about the experience in advance. Honestly there was no need - the seats and leg room were great as was the food which was tasty and plentiful the crew couldn't have been nicer the toilets impeccable! It wasn't cold and the pillow and blanket were if good quality. This is a great airline more cost effective than Thai air or BA. I have no idea what all these people have to moan about! I would definitely use this airline again.,1
I will never book with them again. I am currently stranded in Seattle with my 3 children who I had booked to fly as unaccompanied minors. We called to book their flights and were assured that everything was in order. After a 5 hour drive to the airport today we were told that they could not go on their flight because it was the last flight of the day out of their connecting city. Even after calling twice to confirm everything before we left! We were offered nothing more than an insincere apology. It's like they didn't even care. What pathetic customer service. Will never fly with this airline.,0
"June 25th 2014. My wife and daughter boarded in Boston. The door was closed and we were ready to depart for London. Then a baggage cart hit the airplane. We deplaned and that was understandable. After an hour we were told the plane would not depart and there was no room on any other planes for days. ""Call your friends - make your own arrangements!"" was the only customer relations help offered by British Airways. The BA help on the ground said there were no hotels on vouchers. I really yes really thought British Airways was the standard of air travel. If you have any alternative do not book British Airways. They're great as long as everything is going as planned. If anything goes wrong they are a confused people who have no idea how to help you.",0
I am a frequent flyer due to work but this was my first and last time using Etihad Airways. I would say this was the worst airline I have ever travelled with. The planes are old and cramped the staff are unpleasant and the food terrible. My eight hour flight from Abu Dhabi to Dublin felt like days. I will be using more reputable airlines in the future such as South African Airways or BA.,0
"Business Class into Brunei and back to Brisbane on more of an experience likened to ""can't be bothered with you class"". Safety instructions barely comprehensible no indication of where toilets are curtains drawn all night where staff congregate and socialize but you will see no staff all night. Breakfast terrible - no other offerings are given to you due to the excuse ""we don't have any"". The staff were very offhandish only one toilet was offered for use of all business class passengers as the opposite toilet was closed during the trip. At 5pm in the afternoon the blinds on every window had been drawn by staff and we were expected to go to sleep which about 5 of the 12 or so travellers were doing in the darkened cabin. A member of staff doing a surprise stroll to other end of aircraft nastily says ""keep your voices down as other people are sleeping"". We were chatting to each other in our seats quietly. This was a disrespectful nasty stewardess with bad attitude. I would never fly with this airline again. Try to find their website with the complaints or public relations section I believe it is impossible to find.",0
Each time if you are in the front three rows the crew restrict usage of the overhead in preference to the people not already boarded. This usually means that we end up putting their bag further down the plane and the first three bins usually end up not full and people boarding further back of the plane end up using the bins. It is illogical and rude to the passengers already boarded. Now we have to wait to go down the plane to get our bags. It makes now sense. Frontier you have lost me with your ridiculous policy.,0
LHR-EDI-LHR. Second time using this Little Red offshoot of Virgin and extremely happy to have received the same fantastic service I received the first time. Inflight service was the usual Little Red complimentary offer and was again nice to be offered a Tiger Beer and Tyrell Crisps which was part of the joy last time - the additional round of Love Hearts distributed was a nice touch too! Staff on both outbound and inbound flights friendly and attentive outbound my seat had been changed from the seats I pre-selected online flight wasn't full however and staff were happy for me to move to another empty row by a window. Inbound flight was on an Aer Lingus branded plane substituted for a faulty VS one which was fine although that plane did look a bit tired - I think if anything Aer Lingus should learn a thing or too from running this service on behalf of Virgin and the polish and joy that they manage to pull off - if they applied it to their own service I think they would be to an industry leading product especially by European airline standards which have lacked somewhat in comparison to their Middle- Eastern and East Asian counterparts. Once again however Aer Lingus staff should given a massive pat on the back for the fantastic service they are delivering on behalf of Virgin Atlantic - Purser on my Inbound flight was the same gentlemen as the last time I went to Edinburgh and his enthusiasm and attentiveness should be commended. I am still not enamoured by Heathrow but do appreciate the improved Terminal 2 and on this occasion it wasn't such a bad experience due to it being particularly a quiet time during the day. Virgin however should be proud of the service they are delivering here though will be sad to see this end in September 2015 it is a real shame. Great service and excellent value use it while you can before September - highly recommended!,1
Shanghai Pudong to Singapore a mid haul trip of 5 hours. Unlike all my previous experiences with China Eastern's old aircraft's this was a brand new airbus A300. The business class seat featured full flat beds ample space and very attentive service by the attendants. There was decent inflight entertainment with large touch screen TV. I would highly recommend this flight for this sector in the new airbus since the cost is even less than a Singapore Airlines economy ticket. The same cannot be said of the older China Eastern Boeing 767.,1
Beijing to Seattle. Check-in at Beijing average and no issues boarding a bit of a cattle call. Aircraft A30-200 was showing age. Seating seemed a bit cramped. Food was plentiful but average. AVOD system was acceptable for the length of flight. Flight attendants were pleasant and accommodating. However disappeared after the meal service. For a 5 star rated carrier it was missing in economy must only apply to first class. Would not fly again.,0
Excellent trip to Australia and back. Cabin crew well presented attentive and unobtrusive but there if you need them food is good and plentiful. No alcohol but a frequent round of soft drinks tea and coffee. I will certainly fly with them again. I also liked the 2 stops it broke up the long haul element.,1
Firstly do not be tempted to sit in seats 31 E D F G or 29 A C H I on the Dublin to Boston route the Aer Lingus website will not show that these seats do not recline. I flew Aer Lingus DUB-BOS-DUB in August 2014. It has good staff reasonable planes and routes. But it is really badly let down by its archaic web site with no access to your booking or seat selection before check in tacky interiors with seat pockets hanging off cramped seats some the worst airplane food I have ever had the misfortune to eat. On my transatlantic flight I ended up sitting for 6 hours on the way out in a seat that didn't recline with the person in fronts seat wedged in my face. On the way back I was determined not to let this happen again so chose a middle aisle seat with apparently (on the online check-in website) had seats behind and in front However instead I got a lovely seat beside the toilet which didn't recline as there was a bulkhead behind not shown on their plan. Online check-in is worthless as you still have to queue up in Boston and your carefully printed ticket is torn up and binned. Overall the whole experience was so poor I would much rather go with an airline that actually wants to give passengers a reasonable experience even if it takes a few hours longer to get to my destination.,0
5 hour delay on flight from CPT to JNB very poor communication with passengers and inability to offer water on the flight add up to a very unpleasant experience. Won't use Mango again!,1
Flew Montreal to Tunis via Casablanca and back in April 2012 and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of all four flights. Flights arrived punctually. Service was attentive and friendly. Baggage arrived at destination safely. The stopovers in Casablanca were rather a problem as passengers without dirham's were unable to pay for a coffee or snack. Yet all in all I would not rate this airlines any worse than others I have used for example Delta.,1
Flew from IAD to PRG via CDG. Delayed about 1 hour because of problems with cargo loading air-conditioning during that time not operational. Flight Entertainment had to be reset twice. In cabin about ten screaming infants. Not a pleasant flight.,0
Dubai - Tripoli - Dakar. All in all the flight experience was a pleasure with very good food good seat space and regular drinks - the spare seat next to me also helped. It was also good not to have the flight constantly interrupted by announcements of one kind or another in three different languages as seems to be the trend these days. Tripoli airport isn't a pleasure but no worse than you would expect and every landing seemed calmer than I am used to on the bigger planes. Two big faults though: firstly we had to turn the plane around for a sick passenger and no one made any announcement until about 5 seconds before landing which made most of us think we had turned around for a plane fault. Secondly on the outward flight my bags arrived two days late. Not a disaster for me but certainly it could have been for some people. No apology no attempt to trace me when the bag arrived (though they said they were just about to). Also only 3 movies for 26 hours of flying. Very cheap and comfortable.,0
EDI-AGP. Awful experience rude cabin crew no on-board snacks (free or to purchase) Ryanair are desperate to find fault or earn extra money. Unless you want the person in-front of you basically sitting on your knee then try easyJet or BA.,0
I flew from GRX to BCN on the night of 1 Mar 2013. It wasn't a full flight hence boarding was a breeze. Cabin crew were friendly and the aircraft was really clean and I felt that the legroom was not as limited as other Asian carriers operating A320 that I've been on. Flight departed on time and arrived ahead of schedule. Based on my experience flying on budget carriers in Asia Vueling certainly exceeded my expectation!,1
"While the services associated with flying have been going downhill in the US I just can't believe the return flight I had from Phoenix to Toronto. I am 5' 11"" and I had zero leg room on my flight. There were other passengers around me who were all looking bewildered and as a group the feeling was ""really"". So after we boarded they started playing up the rental revenue pitch for iPADS and the app they have for watching on your personal device but here is a clue AC. Why not make an announcement in the terminal area before the flight so you can download the app that you need to watch on your personal device. Absolutely nothing positive about this airline. They were not less expensive and cattle are treated with more respect. I will never fly Air Canada again because of this experience.",0
HAN-HEL-VIE in Business on time flights great on-board service and comfortable seat on new generation A330 plane. Finnair Lounge appears to be closed in the European Transit area for renovation. Overall good value in comparison with the price paid for the product.,1
Very rude check in staff! I was flying with Emirates from Wellington but since Emirates does not fly directly to Wellington I had a Qantas connection. My hand carry was a little bit over the allowable limit and they won't let me through! I would not have minded re-packing and paying the extra charges but the check in staff were so rude it made me react differently. First they didn't greet me with a smile and then they talked down to me. I support them being strict about policies but there should be room for common sense.,0
I travelled today from Alicante to Manchester on flight LS880. All I can say is that whilst the flight had a brief delay through no fault of the airline the cabin crew were the most helpful and friendly that I have come across on any airline.,1
Travelled to Goa and back on the Dreamliner paid for extra legroom seats both ways 30b and 30c. A nightmare both ways could not stretch our legs these seats are beside the toilets and our feet were trodden on for the flight out and the flight back. At one point we had 8 people standing over us waiting for the toilets. When I complained to Thomson I was told we got what we paid for and they were not responsible for other passengers behaviour. So these seats are to be avoided at all costs.,1
I flew from Mumbai to Brussels and did not have a pleasant experience at all. Food items were spoiled coffee cups were not clean. Seats were uncomfortably squeezed in size. Entertainment facilities was good. I will surely think twice before booking jet again.,0
14-12/2014. Melbourne check in and bag drop was very good - no waiting at all. Seat onboard 737-800 was only just enough in terms of space. Virgins inflight entertainment app was available but the signal was either very weak or too busy because I was unable to connect with my iphone several times and eventually gave up. Cabin was filthy and there was extensive mould and spillage on the seat and particularly the metal joints and was likely made worse by the fact only 1 passenger requested the air conditioning be turned down which made the cabin warmer and more damp. Cabin crew was very gruff and seemed too large to pass down the aisle.,0
BRU-VIE C class on 26-9-14. Check in a disgrace rude handler of passenger lack of staff in business counter and rude staff checked me in in eco. The employee on purpose did not print my Senator number on my boarding pass and had to re-issue the boarding pass in lounge. Temporary lounge a total disaster overcrowded and with service staff that shout and interact in between them. Usual messy boarding with no priority and once on board realised Business class was just the one first row. Crew staff totally uninterested. except a junior stewardess who kindly helped me. For the rest will not recommend.,0
As stated elsewhere the seats/condition of planes are very poor. However there seems to be more legroom. The international flights often come out a lot cheaper - so accept poorer conditions for economy! However the worst part of the flights I've done is the security at an Indian airport. It's atrocious and to be avoided if possible. My last trip travelling from Bangkok to London took more than an hour and that was on airside. To make it more infuriating my hand luggage was searched 4 times and not one was a decent/thorough search - more like they were going through the motions! I will not fly with an Indian stop over any more and would rather pay a little more to avoid it.,0
ORD-PHL-YQB (Quebec City). A320 to PHL - maybe only 45 people on the plane so boarding was quick and we departed the gate early. Flight Attendants were very personable and not what I usually get on US Airways. Maybe the merger with AA is a good thing. Drink service was offered and otherwise FA's walked the aisle a few times for trash. Landing was smooth and great views of Philadelphia. Bus transfer to commuter gates - its strange that if you want to walk to that concourse you have to recheck through TSA but they have a bus transfer that keeps you within security. YQB flight was a CR7 and packed - but FA was nice. Left 20 min late but arrived just 1-2 min late. Overall a nice flight. I know they don't offer inflight entertainment but so many people have their own Ipads and Ipods and such - its not that big of a deal. Keep up the good work.,1
EK751 Dubai to Casablanca on May 8th 2014. Using miles to upgrade from business to first class on a recent Dubai to Casablanca flight I was beyond disappointed in the product and the experience from what I had considered a world class airline eager to stand out amongst its strong rivals like Etihad or Qatar Airways. Not only was the cabin crew service rude and sporadic the inflight entertainment system was faulty the first class catering was not offered and the headsets were defective. And when all this was reported to customer service there was a very passive response to the feedback. This airline was once a star but it is definitely falling from grace.,0
Flew domestic flights on Iran Air (Shiraz-Isfahan Isfahan-Tehran). They were efficient punctual and polite and flights are very cheap. Tehran airport is a mess.,0
We flew between Paris and Baku return. The service was excellent. The food (hot lunch on the way to Baku and hot breakfast on the way back to Paris) very good to excellent much better than on North American airlines. It was our first time on this airline and I would fly them again.,1
Flew round trip from Toronto to Quebec City. First leg was excellent (on-time nice staff). Return flight cancelled due to severe weather which was understandable. However customer support for was nil; staff directed us to help line then vanished and no one was manning the phones (which cut out at 11pm). 3 days later and no response to voicemail or email. All we wanted was advice on whether to stick around for flights or try our luck with the train. Avoid them in the winter months or all together.,0
"Have flown Etihad for many years. My last trip has made me somewhat less enthusiastic. Issues started when I went to KL Ticket Office to change my flights. They changed flights for GBP300 per seat, used to be GBP175 and told me I could no longer have a car from Heathrow to my home at the end of the journey. I explained that I was offered a car when I made the booking, but they said the fare rules had now changed and I was no longer entitled a car. After much complaining and nearly an hour waiting I finally got to speak with the local General Manager. I again stressed I had been offered a car when the booking was made, so I felt they could not simply change the rules. Eventually after 4 days of back and to emails, they confirmed the car from Heathrow. Check in is always a disaster, ditto the Lounge they use. With a couple of flights a day and now with First Class they should either choose a new partner or open their own lounge. The Emirates Lounge is fantastic at KLIA. Flights okay, service and quality of food definitely on the down swing. It's okay but used to be great. Bigger planes mean less attention for passengers which is were Etihad scored in the past. A re-think maybe, before Qatar Airways or Emirates (even BA) start to steal your premium passengers on this route.",1
Domestic Bangkok-Khon Kaen. Aircraft a very old A300-600 which is looking very tired indeed. Cabin crew pleasant enough for this short 40 min hop. Refreshments and a snack is served in a box but really not worth opening. Announcements from the captain could not be heard or understood. You pay a premium fare for this route which is very poor value. Watch out Thai Air Asia are starting on this route soon.,0
Cairo-Warsaw-Wroclaw 8th Sep Wroclaw-Warsaw-Cairo 20th Oct. It was as expensive as Lufthansa but they don't offer a meal or even some drinks for a more than 4 hour flight! Its service is just like a charter but the difference that it is much more expensive. They are so strict on the weight. There is not even 1 screen or any sort of entertainment on these flights.,0
QF35 Melbourne to Singapore. I have been travelling this leg with Qantas for over 15 years and normally travel business class as I did on this occasion. I can tell you that the seats have improved but that is about it. The amenities kit is a waste of money. I do use them normally but compared with the past Qantas could save money and not start to replicate the type of services that they use on jet star. I would also suggest they get back to basics with the menu and ditch Neil Perry. The inflight entertainment range is getting smaller and smaller and if you are a regular traveller like me it starts to become tedious. My loyalty to Qantas once rock solid is I'm afraid no longer. Emirates is now my first choice. I should add the staff on this flight were great but only as good as the tools they are given to use.,0
Our 3 children (20 18 and 13) flew Hanoi-Helsinki and arrived with a delay in Helsinki so they missed their connecting flights to Dusseldorf and then to Nuremberg. Finnair rebooked the children with Air Berlin from Helsinki to Berlin and then onwards to Nuremburg. Still at Helsinki airport it turned out that the Helsinki- Berlin flight was also delayed 1.5 hrs and even though it was clear that the children would under no circumstances reach their connecting flight Berlin-Nuremberg Air Berlin insisted that the children fly to Berlin arriving there late in the evening. Finnair claimed to no longer have responsibility as the children were now customers of Air Berlin. Upon their arrival in Berlin the children were put up in a hotel they had to pay themselves for the taxi transfer there and back. They were booked onto an early morning flight the next day from Berlin-Dusseldorf and then Dusseldorf-Nuremberg. The children finally arrived at Nuremberg airport WITHOUT luggage. We have contacted Finnair through their customer service several times and other than a short meaningless email have not received any feedback. Never again Finnair.,0
BKK-CNX. Used this route last year and product still very good and consistent especially for the price. The passenger lounge at BKK is a real plus and very popular but somehow never seems crowded. Flight on time and baggage waiting - what more can you ask!,1
We travelled to Crete last year different aircraft from another airline clearly very old were told the original had broken down but on returning to U.K. two weeks later found we were on the same plane. The seating was a different configuration so did not get the extra legroom seats we had booked! On landing at the baggage hall we found one of our premium quality cases had one of the wheels ripped off. Did all the claims procedure and got nowhere after six months of emails etc. gave up. We will never use this company again. On the holiday we only saw the rep at the hotel twice on arrival and departure.,0
Checked in for my flight at Rome International Airport to Auckland New Zealand via Hong Kong. Queued to board when a Cathay Pacific hostess said there was a delay to go have lunch then return at 1pm. I returned at 1pm. My flight was still not boarding and no staff present. Waited a further 2 hours before any staff were present to answer questions. Told the flight had been delayed until 9am the next morning to go to the Hilton hotel and those with connecting flights will receive information once there. No explanation for the delay. In the morning we were told that connecting flights would be arranged once we landed at Hong Kong. No boarding gate was given security would not let us through as our boarding passes were for the day before Cathay Pacific staff failed to inform them we were coming. Once at the gate we were told of a further delay until 4pm. Told there were no seats on that days flight to Hong Kong. I was informed my connecting flight from Hong Kong to Auckland would be rescheduled and would be available when I landed. This did not happen. Staff at Hong Kong put me on a later flight. I am extremely annoyed at how the situation was handled. I will never fly Cathay Pacific again.,0
Toronto to Cayo Coco and Cayo Coco to Toronto. 2504 and 2505 July 6th and August 3rd. Everything was very good on the flight except the entertainment system but it being a very short flight it did not bother me. Flight crew extremely friendly and accommodating. The seat could be a little wider and being seated in the aisle seat my arm was bumped several times from people walking by. There just wasn't enough room. This happened when I was using the armrest console for entertainment selections etc. Other than this they were both great flights.,1
We enjoyed our trip from Washington to Copenhagen and back on SAS in July 2013. Despite seeing a number of poor reviews online we found the ground and cabin service to be both professional and pleasant. The notion that the Danes never smile is just nonsense. Went through their online system to upgrade our outward flight and it worked fine. Were unexpectedly upgraded on return.,1
Flew from Gatwick to Orlando Sanford and return 25th July - 8th August 2013. Upgraded to premium cabin. Very little benefit as compared to other airlines. Faults on seat recline on both journeys. Inflight entertainment and food poor quality and premium baggage labels ignored as bags were not unloaded first as per the claim on their website. Would not fly with Monarch again.,0
Cork-Glasgow route (operated by Aer Arann) on 24th Oct - not a pleasant experience. Flight was 2hrs late leaving - explanation given was the plane was late arriving. Departing Glasgow on 29th Oct was again nearly 2 hrs late (no explanation given on this occasion). Every time I have used this route it is delayed and speaking with other passengers I am not alone! The aircraft is always dirty - coffee spills down the seats/walls seem to be a permanent fixture and added to that the dirty magazines and paper wrappings left behind in the seat pockets. If I had a choice I certainly would not recommend this route to anyone.,0
Flew to Muscat via Istanbul and returned a month later. Very pleasant experience. Take off and landing super. Took advantage of tour of Istanbul and the use of the hotel on our return leg. Food good. However the ground crew not friendly at all but cabin crew were superb.,1
"TAP are charging shockingly high business class prices on their route from Lisbon to Sao Tome. The flight time via Acra is almost 7 hours and in my ignorance and bearing in mind we paid more than Â£2000 per seat I thought I would get something approaching reasonable seats and service. TAP are using A320's on the route in European configuration. This means that business has little or no more leg room the only benefit being that the middle row of three is not filled. They maintain that the seats are wider but on both our flights were not. This may be OK for a 2 hour business class route in Europe but not on a long haul flight like this at the prices that are being charged. The service was lacklustre and staff seemed to have little interest, the food was OK but inadequate for such a long flight and I arrived at the end of the SAO-LIS tired, hungry and feeling that I had been badly ripped off. I appreciate that an aircraft the size of an A320 is ideal for this route but there is no reason why TAP cannot invest in re-configuring the aircraft into a more suitable layout. BA for example use the same aircraft on a 5 hours plus run to Beirut yet have proper business class sleep seats at the front of the aircraft. If they really cannot do this then charge a small supplement but do not con passengers into thinking they are getting good comfort and service. This is one of the worst airline experiences in relation to value I have had and frankly would have rather flown Ryanair. From the moment we checked in in Lisbon the approach was lackluster. It just got worse from there.",0
SCL-TEM PMC-PUQ-SCL. First 2 legs were fine friendly service decent IFE considering they were short flights. First leg on a pretty new A318 2nd and 3rd on new A320s with comfortable leather seats. Final flight was delayed in PUQ for 3 hours 1 hour delay communicated at checkin counter afterwards no more communication. Food vouchers handed out. Once in the air another 3 hour stop at Balmaceda airport. Food vouchers handed out again. Service on the plane was good friendly FAs on all flights. Communication could have been better. Finally arrived with 6 hours of delay.,1
BKK-CAI-DUS return. BKK-CAI on very old and run down B777-200. Business class seats the ultimate nightmare. No legroom and seat hardly reclines. The seats in Y class looked more comfortable. No menu only fish or chicken or beef poor quality of food. Blankets were out of stock. I was unable to view the IFE since the tiny screens could not be brought into position while the person in front of me declined his seat. There was simply not enough space. Amenity bags only available on BKK-CAI not on the return flight. No toothbrush eye-shade and earplugs available. Overall the ultimate horror flight. What a difference from CAI-DUS - new B737-800 with comfortable seats good service good IFE and food with a menu and blankets.,0
I have travelled with Egyptair for years. The latest was 3 days ago. The carrier was 777-300 . The service was excellent. Departure was delayed 15 minutes due to late passengers. Take off was professional as well as the landing. I enjoyed the PTVs. Journey was from CAI-RUH (Riyadh-Saudi Arabia).,1
Why on earth is the A380 not on the LHR-BKK route? These old 747's should be pensioned off after 23 years despite the upgraded seats which are the most uncomfortable Biz class I've ever tried to sleep in all angles and too short for a chance of a good night on the 12 hour journey. Food for such a wonderful cuisine is a disgrace why can't they even prepare a simple stir-fry or a red curry? The cheese was a measly piece of plastic hard cheese and a triangle of factory brie have they been on Qatar recently? AV system is so outdated with limited film choice when compared to BA/CX and even EVA from Europe to Asia. Wines were all French high alcohol and totally the wrong choice for 38000 feet up we want low alcohol Riesling and Pinot. Flew on the date of the Kings birthday supposed special menu was a complete cock-up the poor crew had no idea what was onboard and changed my main choice 5 times. The only reason I still felt with them is I'm a gold member and get to use my million miles for upgrades once they're all gone I'm off in a flash. Despair.,0
"MIA-DUS-BER. First impression was new airplane and very clean. Seats ok seat pitch compact. Staff correct but not very attentive and definitively rude when confronted. IFE excellent if you have brought your headphones or pay the ?? charge. The rest of the trip uneventful except for the very tired airport facilities at DUS and TXL. Return flight was nonstop TXL-MIA. Priority access only granted after insisting twice that we were Gold Status or OneWorld Ruby; nobody seems to have been instructed on what that means. Same plane IFE staff with a little better attitude though nowhere be found once they hand out ""the bottle of water"". Food was above average wine as always: one glass. Luggage handling ok. Rates are ok but same as other main carriers especially those belonging to One World. AB will have to do a lot to take advantage of their recent incorporation.",0
"Spirit fare is cheaper than most airlines, but are the worse in customer services. It is better to pay a little more at different airline and have better service. On my last flight, when we arrived at the airport, the airline just canceled the flight saying it was a cancel in Chicago due to rain.  No other airlines had the delay. We had to book a different flight and lost 1 day and 1 night worth for hotel and car rental. Spirit does nothing to accommodate that. A little delay is fine and no airline is perfect. ",0
Flew LHR-DOH on the A380 Lounge access at LHR was great - really personalised service. Felt like being in a swanky hotel rather than a lounge. On-board the seats were fine not as nice as Emirates but for sure a comfy space. Great food and beverage service little tip they leave the Krug at the bar worth the walk over! IFE was a bit skippy. DOH-RHY on 787 they used Business but rebrand it as first Short trip so fine - not a major fan of the 787. The lounge in Riyadh is abysmal but it's shared. Spent time in duty free to avoid this lounge. Doha terminal nice easy to have a long layover especially here with the family rooms available for a sleep and Krug on Tap. Don't recommend the 45 min transfer the terminal is big and there is no help on connections to get you there on time - at least they let business out as priority so I had a chance and the run woke me up a little bit. DOH-LHR was on the Business One A319 aircraft. Comfortable Seats IFE didn't work properly (kept skipping again but more frequently) but as they handed out PJ's it encouraged everyone to go to sleep. Service on both legs excellent.,1
Spirit isn't cheap as they advertise the cost of the ticket then the charge for a bag (even a carry-on is charged) $3.00 for water even more for snacks by the time you pay for everything it is around the same price as other airlines. The seats in Spirit are small I am a short average woman and I didn't even fit into their seats at least with other airlines I always have enough room. The airline staff were horrible they were always chit chatting with each other or someone they knew on the plane. I will never fly or recommend Spirit airlines.,0
Flew from Dublin to St. John's and then to Halifax on May 11th. Flight 2 hours late out of Dublin but I don't think this inconvenienced many travelers. We had a 4 hour scheduled stopover in St. John's so it was better to spend 2 hours of this in Dublin. Airline was good in notifying us of delay in departing well in advance (inbound aircraft was late). Full 737 with average flight attendants and in flight entertainment. No food is offered on this flight other than a small amount from a buy-on-board menu. No big deal if you know this in advance as I did. Have a wonderful Irish breakfast at the Dublin airport before leaving and you'll be fine as the flight to St. John's is only 4 hours and 20 minutes. Good water and soft drink/coffee runs and a fast and convenient way across the Atlantic.,1
"Flew EWR-KEF and KEF-MUC on Economy Class. Reading some reviews I expected a bad experience but everything was fine. Checked in with my mobile phone in EWR, unfortunately the TSA couldn?t read the ticket so I had to go back to the Check in counter to get the boarding pass. Flight was on time and the crew was very friendly. Got an emergency exit seat during check in for free, so I had enough space but the standard Economy seats looked like they have good pitch. The only thing I couldn't deal with was the mood light, but I donÂ´t like it on any airline. I just prefer a dark cabin during flight. Boarding the first flight everyone got a bottle of water, which was refilled during the trip, the crew offered drinks a few times during both legs. Food was for purchase and rather expensive but booking on the airline?s web site I knew that before so I had a nice dinner at EWR and bought some chips for the second leg to MUC. KEF is a very small and pleasant airport for transit. From the moment of disembarking to my connection flight I needed less than 10 minutes. I will definitively fly Icelandair again in the future, yet the planes are good and the two crews that attended my flights were excellent. And with 380 EUR the price was more than good.",1
Miami-Nassau. In principle everything worked out fine. B737's are very old check in took enormously long time. Very strict on weight and size of carry-on baggage. Onboard the staff gave the clear message that they would really like to be somewhere else than on that aircraft. They were totally unmotivated and not offering service. Almost all the journey they were gathered in the aft galley eating. Otherwise the flight was nice with plenty of information from the flight deck.,0
Used to love flying with Etihad especially when I had my silver status with them. But my last 3 flights with them have lacked heavily with poor customer service 7 hours flight delay in Abu Dhabi and staff didn't provide any quality information unfriendly staff at gate 59 that day last month. Great customer service by staff in Australia and Germany but the UAE headquarters in Abu Dhabi is the one that pulls down the whole airline performance. Seats are still great and entertainment is ok but could be updated a little. Always flying MEL-TXL-MEL. Staff members wake you up while sleeping only to ask you if you want to have dinner. Thinking about doing future travel with Qatar airways.,0
I have travelled several times with Aerolineas. Buenos Aires-Rio De Janeiro and Montevideo. Domestically I have flown between Buenos Aires and Mendoza Cordoba and Salta. I only have praise for the staff and organisation of this airline. I have encountered polite efficiency from check in staff and air crew the aircraft were clean and I experienced no delay or problems with the flights.,1
Flew business class XMN-TPE-SFO and return LAX-TPE-XMN. Impressed by the refurbished cabin. The new seats are comfortable but are not lie-flat. Inflight meals are good but you can feel the catering quality outbound is better than inbound. The new LCD screen is higher definition one which makes inflight entertainment better.,1
Travel in December 2013 in Nairobi via Addis Abba to Zanzibar route the first full flight a 767 old narrow seats but friendly staff and good food service. The transit in Addis Abba was fast. Flight Nairobi to Zanzibar via Dar es Salaam: left on time good food and friendly assistance. A good experience.,1
Flew Bangkok to Paro round-trip both flights via Calcutta. Outbound I was in Economy Plus and the legroom was excellent. The breakfast was well served hot and tasty-far more substantial that is offered on many other carriers. On the return I was upgraded to business and the leather seat was roomy and comfortable. The meal (lunch) was good but the performance of the crew was truly world-class. I have to say that I was very impressed by the professionalism and demeanour they displayed. In business one is given access to priority clearance in Bangkok which worked well but still a long wait for baggage-though mine was the first bag out. Excellent offering overall.,1
Recently flew Birmingham to Hurghada. When checking in I asked if we could sit as close to the front of the plane as possible and was allocated row 10. Legroom was ok but seats were of the old variety. I thought Monarch were retrofitting their seats so it was disappointing to get the old armchair seats. Service Onboard was great. Check in at Hurghada was a different story. I again asked if we could be sat quite close to the front but was told that we had to pay for extra legroom seats. Speaking to one check in agent he said it was Â£30 per seat but as 5 people were travelling he would do us a deal of 3 seats for the price of 5. I doubt this was company procedure and the monies would have made their way into the check in agents pockets. Appreciate Monarch can't vouch for all those working in behalf of the company but they need to be aware that others are trying to profit from their usual jobs as we have been seated in what are the extra legroom seats on return flights free of charge previously. Service was slow onboard but we landed 40 mins ahead of schedule.,0
Last week BKK-HKT-BKK. Both flights A320's in very nice condition. Departures and arrivals pretty much on the mark. FA's friendly and professional. And a meal on an hour long flight! This is a terrific regional airline and I hope they control their growth so they do not lose all the little things that make them unique. The airport lounges were a nice touch. Will continue to use whenever possible.,1
AMS-PTY-AMS Round trip Amsterdam to Panama City with a layover in Madrid. Flight AMS-MAD with a A320. Flight ok staff friendly. MAD-PTY with a brand new A330. Great flight nice entertainment system. First meal very nice but the sandwich and snack afterwards were not very good very dry. Staff was ok. PTY-MAD with an older A340. Seats were ok but no IFE system only main screen. Food the same as on the other flight first meal good other meals dry and stale. Staff ok. Last flight MAD-AMS with A320. ok flight no remarks there. For the price we paid these flights were good value for money and on time.,1
Food service on flight from Sydney to Port Vila very slow. Fight was 2 hours under way before we received our meal with no choice as to what we wanted. Connecting flight from Vila to Santo delayed one hour and luggage was left behind. Our return flight was as equally disappointing my wife and I were seated together on flight from Santo to Vila with my daughter and then the flight from Villa to Sydney on the same aircraft my wife I were allocated seats apart from each other. This fight was not full but the cabin service was better than our flight over. Even though the flight was not full when I got my food I again was not given a choice in fact staff had trouble finding me a dinner. I have flown Air Vanuatu several times in the past and was very happy with the service but this time was very disappointing.,0
Left LAX on Saturday to take my daughter to Providence. Flight delayed and we missed out connecting flight to providence was stranded in Philadelphia. They did not offer any help and just gave us new tickets to come back to airport next day. Sunday morning went to airport realizing that they had booked my 16 daughter on a different flight to DC! Ended up renting a car and driving. Went back to airport on Monday 7/22 to catch my flight to LAX. Flight from Providence was late again and I missed my connection again. Was re-routed to Phoenix and stayed on the plane for 3 hours for bad weather and missed the connection from Phoenix to LA. Stranded in Phoenix again and finally made it to Orange county airport on Tuesday.,0
MH1143 June 8 2014 PEN-KLIA. Boarding was easy. The seat was comfortable. Snack was peanuts. Juice was offered. The staff were excellent.,1
Norwegian Oakland - Stockholm with Premium Class on June 14th Dreamliner Boeing 787. Smooth check in at Oakland airport using faster lane comfortable seats and friendly Thai crew. Left and arrived on schedule. Service was fine and food equivalent to Premium Economy. Two meals included was average I bought snacks later since I was still hungry. Only one wine or beer beverage included (except for small cognac with coffee) otherwise alcoholic drinks are extra for remainder of flight. Entertainment system just OK only around 10 recent movies most options are re-runs. Still a decent value considering the non-stop flight and that Business Class on other airlines costs around $1000 more.,1
"I recently took four Comair (British Airways) flights in Zimbabwe and South Africa. While the aircraft appeared a little tired, I was impressed with the business class cabin service, catering was good for the series of short flights undertaken and seemed on a par with short-haul Qantas 737-800 international service. If requesting a seat during the booking process, I recommend selecting 1 D E or F. While there are three seats on this side of the aircraft rarely is the middle seat used. These seats are exit row and can, depending on the aircraft configuration, have up to almost a metre of legroom. All Business seats behind row 1 appear only to have legroom akin to economy class (which begs the question why pay so much extra for no more legroom). I fly business class regularly and would happily fly Comair again when next in Africa, and BA when travelling in Europe.",1
VA 867 20th May 2014. VA 898 30th May 2014. Flying VA from Melb to Sydney we were treated as people with kindness beyond expected staff from managers to check in to wheelchair and luggage assistance to meals. They deserve the award for compassion care and efficiency.,1
Xi'an to Beijing Capital. Nice Airbus A320 flight with o/h Video playing comedy programmes during short 1 hr 22 min duration. Cabin crew worked hard to serve Lunch pity that the Beef seemed on the tough side and rice was rather cold. Cabin crew give out details of flight progress nothing from flight deck crew which seems to be the norm in China.,1
KHI-DXB. Had to go earlier to DXB change of booking was very easy check-in was a little bit slow but ground staff very friendly. Flight was very early in the morning so after the check in I fell asleep. The friendly ground staff woke me up at the last minute. Flight was on time the plane in good condition nice seats and good legroom. On the flight they served a hot snack and hot and cold drinks. Would fly them again.,1
Etihad flight EY97 from Abu Dhabi to Istanbul - Business Class. Cabin crew were friendly and welcoming. A glass of fruit juice or Champagne was offered on boarding. Meal service (lunch) was efficient and providing a nice choice. Quality of food was very good. Wine offered was also very good. Entertainment was the same offered in economy but personal screens were larger. Seats were very comfortable.,1
LHR-BKK on retrofitted 747-400. Good seats with big pitch superior IFE and although the food was average it was fine. The staff are really great too and my 3 year old was given lots of attention and a good in flight pack. Much better than BA.,1
Sunday 13th March I travelled from Hobart to Sydney. Staff were friendly and flight was smooth. However I was seated in row 30 and the leg room (pitch) was about 22cm from the edge of my seat to the magazine pocket. We had to put our carry-on luggage under he seat because there was no room in the overhead storage area. I stress that the flight attendants were excellent.,0
"We had a terrible flight out with extremely cramped seats. The return from Antalya to Manchester was a bit better but crew were rude and unhelpful. When I politely asked if I could have a pillow for the night flight home I was told there were none. I asked why since it was a night flight and the stewardess just snapped back ""Don't ask me"". She tore the complaints form out of the flight magazine and told me to fill it in if I was unhappy. Wonder where that finished up as it was just to be handed to the cabin crew not even in an envelope!!",0
"My sister and I decided to go to Barbados for Easter. Booked business class. We were very shocked when we got on the plane and saw what Rouge defines as business class. Paid the same price as a regular Air Canada business ticket but definitely did not feel that we were flying business. Staff were young and trying their best but could not pacify the unhappy passengers in ""business class"". I decided to make the best of it but its difficult to enjoy your flight when everyone around you is so angry. The iPad we were given was a joke! Movies were not even close to be current releases. Every time I paused the movie I was forced back to the beginning. Very frustrating. I think the worst part was the passengers from economy coming up to ""business class"" to use the lavatory. I had an aisle seat with people from the back of the plane forming a line beside me. If I wanted people to hover around me I would have booked economy. When I asked the attendant if they should be up here she said no but did nothing about it. The attendants had no control over the situation. We were in the last row of ""business"" on the way home and had the first row economy person constantly pushing on my seat. Again this is something you expect in economy class. It was a long flight which I usually don't mind when I am sitting in business. But this is not business! I am very hesitant to book Air Canada ever again as I am afraid that it will be another Rouge flight.",0
TXL-MAD-TXL booked last minute and got a cheap fare. Planes appeared to be clean with the exception of the carpets which were very dirty. Also noticed many broken parts of the cabin interior handles of baggage compartments were fixed with tape and a sharp metal piece stuck out of the tray table. The seats were leather and comfortable but legroom was tight. Flights were not full we could spread out and they were on time. The cabin crew were quite nice but going through the routine. Would consider again if price is right.,1
"We flew to Kos in 2014 and weren't disappointed. We found the journey easy, cabin crew were welcoming and cabi had a bright feel. The seats were comfy and food enjoyable. ",1
"Business class, what a joke! Economy seats just leaving the middle seat vacant does not make it business class. The only good thing I can find to say is that it was on time and safe. Food was better left alone.",0
We arrived in the north of St. Lucia to be told that our plane had already left - apparently it was our fault that we didn't know we were supposed to have received an email regarding this but we did not. There were no apologies or pleasantries as we were re-booked on two alternative flights 4 hrs later taking a much longer route to arrive at St Vincents (originally a 30 mins flight). On the second flight from Barbados to St Vincents there was no water and no usable toilet. The stewardess was uninterested and kept yawning. When we arrived at St. Vincent later that evening all of our luggage had been mislaid between St. Lucia Barbados and St. Vincent. We reported the situation to a rather dispassionate lady at the LIAT desk and then continued to our destination. We phoned LIAT the next morning and the service person was abrupt. They had found 4 of our 5 bags and didn't seem to know whether to send them to us or not. They sent the 4 bags and when they located the 5th later that day they wanted to wait until the next day to send that - which would have been a problem since we were traveling.,0
I was hesitant about flying with China Southern after reading a lot of mixed reviews but we gave them the benefit of the doubt. We flew from sydney to Guangzhou in January. The service was excellent. For the whole flight staff walked up and down the aisles. They were funny and kind. I think the service made this experience one of the best I've had. Inflight entertainment was fantastic! I was surprised as a lot of movies and songs were pretty recent. The food was quite nice. During the flight there was also food offered if you got hungry. Seats were very spacious and comfortable. Overall probably the best flight experience I've had and will definitely be picking China Southern on my next trip.,1
TZ 2 19 June SIN/SYD in Scootbiz. Rubbish the cabin crew disappear they muddle the food and they lack the basic standards. Not impressed at all!,0
They took good care of passengers. When I was waiting to board I felt unwell so I informed staff. They took action immediately and took special care of me. It was impressive and a memorable experience.,0
BCN-LUX with connection LUX-FRA in Business class. Was somewhat concerned that the first leg was with a Dash-8-Q400. However the aircraft was clean and well kept. Meal service consisted of assorted canapes and fresh rolls. Drinks ranged from wonderful Champagne to wines beers and non- alcoholic beverages. The connection to FRA was just as pleasant albeit for a flight of appx 40 minutes on a B737 once again canapes bread and a full beverage service offered. This airline is small but amazing.,0
Flight from Guangzhou to Amsterdam on 1/1/2014 flight CZ 307. In Guangzhou counter staff were not friendly check in for first/business class at a separate counter with friendly staff and very fast. Departures after midnight on time and after take off staff provided a full dinner menus. I am a CZ gold member (elite plus) and have always taken their flight. The in-flight service was professional on A330-200 with fully flat beds. I don't use the entertainment system so no comment on that. All flights attendants and purser with good English speaking smile and small talk. Flight arrived at destination on time. Will fly with CZ again in the future.,1
"Arrived for check in slightly late - large queue so Business desk was opened for me - very friendly check in staff at LHR. Enjoyable flight on Qatar Airways, friendly staff and good service. A drink not long after departure, drink with the meal and a post dinner drink (including good quality Armagnac) plus drinks on request. Champagne was offered in economy - not the most common offering and a welcome change from other airlines who often only offer red/white wine and beer for economy passengers. Comfortable seats with a good range of English, International, Arabic programmes meant the flight was more than tolerable. Food a little highly salted - offerings were chicken/beef with rice/potatoes, nothing ground breaking but nothing to complain about either. Only negative was that like most Gulf airlines it's lacks character - something I enjoy when flying with flag carriers.",1
My wife and I flew from Paris to Barcelona and Barcelona to Rome recently and I too was very concerned having read some of the comments made however each of our flights were great. On time and I think in both cases we arrived early at our destination. Check in was no problem.,1
Las Vegas to Frankfurt April 2013 Premium Economy. I had a rather pleasant experience with Condor something much better than I had expected. The seats were comfortable despite the lack of a headrest and had adequate legroom. Seating arrangement is 2-3-2 which is best when traveling with family. There is no barrier separating Premium Economy with Economy but this was no problem. As far as food all options in the menu card were of meat or fish so it was a good choice in selecting vegetarian meals for us. Our preferred meals arrived and were more than sufficient; lots of side dishes and snacks accompanied the main course. The flight attendants were friendly and I had no problems with them. Entertainment: there are overhead screens in all cabins and the film selection was decent coming in both German and English. Overall I enjoyed my 10hr flight with Condor and would definitely fly them again.,1
"What an embarrassment for Air Canada. I have spent the last 3 or 4 years defending the ""new"" Air Canada for the quality and safety of travel with them (you know the drill about their ""award winning"" status). After my family's Rouge experience I am back at square 0. Let me count off the ways Rouge made us see red on our recent trip to Hawaii: 1) highly punishing and inefficient boarding process both in Vancouver and in Honolulu 2) primitive entertainment services 3) a 1980s vintage and obsolete B-767 where essential functions like lighting to read by didn't work 4) hours of discomfort in seats that hinted at promiscuity (that's how close they are to each other front to back and side to side) 5) a Rouge crew that was decidedly green (we figure that this must be a training ground for new Air Canada staff and the perky uniform is decidedly weird). So my family's take is: avoid AC Rouge and go WestJet or take a US carrier even if it costs more.",0
"On entering the aircraft for a flight from Gatwick to Antalya we noticed it had not been well cleaned there were papers and empty plastic bottles on the floor and under seats. This didn't inspire confidence. There were few meal options left and 2 of the meal trays were not as shown in the brochure. We didn't hear from the captain at all (his English not up to it?) but the cabin crew were friendly and efficient. No inflight entertainment (but it didn't matter to me). Not enough leg room for my friend who was 5' 8"". She had to sit diagonally.",0
Flight from Barbados to Grenada repeatedly delayed for 10 hours and cancelled at 1.30am. Told we could not be guaranteed a seat on flight the next day. Put in a hotel overnight. No complimentary refreshments offered at any time. I eventually got on a (delayed) flight the following afternoon after arguing at the check-in desk. On arrival I discovered my luggage had not made it on to the flight due to the plane being overweight. My luggage eventually arrived 2 days later. Minimal communication from staff and customer service was non-existent. My return flight was also delayed and as a result I almost missed my connecting flight home. I will never use LIAT again.,0
"Departed Jorge Newbury Airport (AEP) Buenos Aires to GaleÃ£o-(GIG) Rio de Janeiro. Flight number AR 2252- 22 August 2012. Embraer 190 aircraft. Arrived at the airport in time for a 9.50am departure. There were many announcements in Spanish but very few in English until English speaking passengers enquired at departure gates. Flight was 1 hour late with no explanation given. Flight itself was fantastic however cabin crew were less than friendly and did not even check our boarding pass to direct us to our assigned seat as we boarded. Inflight ""snack"" was some sort of carrot cake caramel filled biscuit covered in a white chocolate substance with a caramel sweet.",1
MUC-WAW-MUC very nice flight. Embraer 175 both ways. Very nice aircraft legroom was good. Flights left on time both ways. We were served a sandwich plus full bar service. Cabin crew was friendly. Warsaw Airport is bright and friendly. Would definitely fly LOT again on European routes.,1
CGN-HAM-THR at the end of December 2004 and back January 2005. First of all our flight was originally CGN-THR but due to one or another reason they flew to HAM first filled up the rather old but clean A310-300 with further passengers and then proceeded to THR. The result was that we arrived 6 hours delayed compared to what was previously planned. At least they called us one day before departure and told about the itinerary change. Furthermore we got a voucher of EUR 15- each for use in restaurants at CGN due to the delay. Inflight service was nice food was fine and women did not have to wear the headscarf onboard any more. Also took domestic flight at several occasions when travelling in Iran. THR-IFN IFN-SYZ KSH-THR and BND-THR (intermediate stop at IFN) on F100 B727 and A300B4 were fine on time good catering. They keep an old fleet that well-maintained and clean.,0
Dublin to Istanbul 27 Dec returning on 1 January. Outgoing flight TK 1978/27 return flight TK 1975/01. Great service staff and entertainment. Couldn't fault this airline and I am a frequent flyer. Would definitely recommend using their services again.,1
I recently booked a holiday through Thomson Holidays in the UK. We were informed that they had booked us on Air Europa flights to Tenerife and return back to Glasgow. A 4.5 hour flight with no inflight entertainment no inflight magazines to read no provision for my dietary requirements the trolley dolly didn't even know what I was talking about when I asked for a cider from the bar! The overhead air mover above my seat was out of its socket and didn't work. What a third rate airline! If this airline is to be used again by Thomson Holidays god help their profit margins because travellers will refuse to book with them if this is how they are going to be treated.,0
"BOM-DEL-FRA: Both sectors were operated by 787 Dreamliner. BOM-DEL was early morning flight so they served breakfast which was warm good and filling. On the both the sectors I noticed that cabin crew are quite different. Either one is polite and second is just ""veg"" or ""non-veg"". I am sorry but we are not sitting at a street side cafe. Air India is the flag carrier of India and the crew should understand very well that they are representing our country on foreign land. DEL-FRA sector was delayed by 50 mins but crew member on my row was very polite and welcoming. Cabin crew on other side of row was just disinterested and rude. As I have said before (see below) crew does lack inter-personal skills and need professional training. It was like flying two different airlines being in same aircraft. Cabins need to be regularly cleaned. Toilets should be in perfect condition. Food quality needs to be urgently improved. Captain needs training to interact with passengers on regular period. Its high time AVOD has to be upgraded. AI has to learn a lot all of this from thier own partners TK LH and SQ.",1
"We flew to Puerto Vallarta on the new Dreamliner 787 and found the aircraft a lot better than most I have been on. There is plenty more leg room and especially as my husband is 6' 4"" having the extra leg room on a long haul flight meant he had a much more comfortable trip. I'm not sure how the 'dancing disco' lights are supposed to help with jet lag though. My only issue is with the flight attendants. On the outbound flight they were nothing less than rude. They gave the impression that we as passengers were putting them out when they came around to serve us. Everyone was 'thrown' a rubbish bag and we were 'told' not asked 'told' to collect all our rubbish up including on the floor space around us! When we were exiting the flight I tried to make polite conversation with one of the attendants as we waited to exit. All I got was a shrug of the shoulders and an eyeball roll!",1
I like this airline would choose it in future and would recommend to others. Only issue is the leg from Mumbai to Goa which is often delayed and seems unorganised but fly business class and like that I can accrue airmiles via jet privilege club membership.,1
Flew DEN-JFK then CDG-MSP-DEN in Business. Was pleasantly surprised as I had not travelled DL in about 10 years. Domestic segments decent with excellent service and meals. Crew chatty and actually acted like they wanted to there. CDG-MSP with flat seats on A330. Crew were okay but still miss the class of European carriers and kindness of EK/SQ. No smiles and rather perfunctory service. Food better than AF and seat much better; Entertainment was excellent with big screen and got about 3 hours of good sleep. Only negative was appalling ground staff at JFK- rude surly and could care less. Will avoid JFK as best as I can.,1
Sydney to Chicago (one stop in Seoul) with my wife on Asiana Airlines in business class. We found the check in staff lounge staff and cabin crew to be in a completely different league to other airlines. The professional and respectful service is so consistent across the board. Seats were excellent (more so on the Quadra Smartium to Chicago) fine dining was impeccable inflight entertainment abundant and service was the best we've experienced. An excellent premium class service and flights exceeded our five star expectations.,1
I just come back from a trip to the west coast: CDG-SFO-CDG. For the first time I flew on XLAirways. The check-in was quite good. However the boarding was a little bit of a mess in Paris. There were mothers with babies who had not been even taken care of. During the flight the kindness of the crew was quite good and its efficiency too. Seats would have leant a bit more you could have thought you were in business class.,1
Travelled to St Lucia in January premium economy out and upper class return. Online check in was very easy but twilight bag drop at Gatwick not possible on arrival at 4.30pm and we had to queue for 1 hour to check our bags in probably because they have reduced the twilight check in time from 2pm to 5pm and only 2 staff were on duty. The new 330 wide bodied aircraft is much more cramped in premium economy than the 747 when travelling in the bubble which was a joy. The aisles are narrow causing more disturbance to passengers and some people are allocated seats in 3s with the loss of privacy for couples. However the lighting and the entertainment were a big improvement and the food was good so overall the PE experience was acceptable. The return in upper class was poor value. Similarly cramped compared with the jumbo and it is no longer feasible to share a meal with your partner as the aisles are too narrow. There is some personal privacy at night and the beds were OK although you are quite near to the seats opposite the herringbone pattern works. Service disturbs sleepers due to the narrow aisles as stewards constantly knock into feet or the ends of beds. During the day it would be impossible to talk to you partner unless you got up as the screens do not fold down so you are very much in your own space which is probably good for business passengers. The upper class meal was truly dreadful. It was impossible to eat the steak so I exchanged it for chicken which was also dry and tough. The stewardess suggested the only decent meal was vegetarian and several people were sending their food back but by that time I had lost interest. Why do they serve lumps of meat which have to be re-heated? Food was much nicer in PE. Overall the service in upper class has deteriorated with reduced costs evident and we were very disappointed.,0
Funchal-Zurich 14 Feb 2015 business class. Warm welcome from the captain at the aircraft door cabin crew very friendly and attentive during all the flight. Welcome drinks served on the ground. Menu presented to each passenger with excellent quality of all items two cold starters 3 options of main course tray with cheese desserts and chocolates. Everything was done with time and attention drinks and hot bread offered several times and even a pre arrival snack was given. Onboard music entertainment system but not individual screens for the movie. Overall the best business class product I know on European flights.,1
I just flew Georgian Airways (Air Zena) between Vienna and Tbilisi and return to Vienna and was impressed with the service and equipment. I was in a rather new 737 that looked like it was maintained and clean. Even the food was decent a chicken dish that was quite tasty. One thing did concern me and that was during the 3.5 hour flight back to Vienna from Tbilisi the pilot on more than one occasion was milling around on the passenger side of the cockpit and on a number of these occasions the door to the cockpit was open and all of this was within feet of the forward lavatory. The pilot seemed more interested in chatting with the flight attendants then he did with flying the plane. But all in all it was a good experience. My bags arrived in Tbilisi from Vienna which I am told is a feat sometimes.,0
Took Korean Air the first time from Singapore to Hokkaido and back. Was surprised that it only allowed 1 piece of check-in baggage which caused a lot of inconvenience for me and my fiancee. Plane was clean and the staff provided good service. Food could be better but still edible. The 1 check-in luggage policy really lowers my impression of the airline.,0
"Day trip to Vienna, used BA Economy as their Business Class fares are a complete rip off on BA these days. Heathrow T3 departure experience is quite shoddy compared to T2 or main BA flights out of T5. Service onboard the flight was perfunctory at best, and staff seem to perform to a script - in some cases portray the feeling that because they wear a BA uniform they think they are so excellent - a sad fact is their standards are below several major European airlines. The Purser, CSD (or whichever grand title they give to cabin staff) on outbound flight spent a lot of time giggling in the galley like a 6 year old child, and then proceeded to make the PA announcements in the campest and most disrespectful tone of voice - again, this seemed to be done for the amusement of his fellow t-d's. As a oneworld Emerald (not with BA!), I stick with oneworld members, but Austrian offer a much better service and quality standard than BA.",0
I took the JFK to Madrid in Business class - the food was well below average the service was ok the crew did not care about customers and had fun all night on my return flight in the kitchen making the business class customer sleep impossible. On the round trip I had 2 hours delay in NY and 1 hour in Madrid. I was told to be lucky because the day before they had 10 hours delay. On the entertainment side 5 movies which are the same on both legs. I won't fly them again!,0
"I booked a premium economy ticket so I can have a suitcase and one piece of baggage. That cost ~30Euros more than the Go Light fare. Suddently as we were waiting for the boarding to start, the airline representatives announced that every person who has the Cheapest fare, can put his baggage in the compartment with no charge. I find no reason to pay extra money and being fooled with this policy. All the other provided services were far above medium, approaching excellence. I will fly again with Aegean but the ticket policy needs serious reconsideration",1
Frankfurt-Beijing-Singapore and back. Flights on time and relatively cheap. No hello and no goodbye no thank you and no please from the crew. I asked for a glass of wine but was told that they only open the bottle with the food. My neighbor wanted a third glass of wine and was told he had enough. No spirits in economy. I eat just about anything and I have never really had reason to complain about airline food before but just the smell of the food was awful. Food was bland and servings were small. They had drinks like juice in the kitchen for passengers to help themselves. Our 4 year old daughter didn't get any special attention. The cabin crew didn't smile and it felt like you are a burden to them. Inflight Entertainment had a small choice of bad movies. On one leg there were problems with the sound. Annoying announcements throughout the flight. The seatbelt sign was switched on throughout all flights.,0
I was also on the same nightmare flight and got stranded in Sharjah. If Phuket air did not think they done anything wrong or that there were no problems with the planes they should have been available and around the hotels talking to us. We are still waiting for an apology.,0
Harare to Amsterdam on A330-200. I paid business class fare expecting to get some sleep during the flight. Business class seats described as 'flat beds' but they were nowhere near that. Just an angular recline which is not comfortable at all. Would have been better off paying for an economy class seat. since I didn't notice any difference.,0
First we were over 1.5 hours late for take off from the Minneapolis then had to sit for over 20 minutes on the ground in Fort Lauderdale due to not having a gate because of our late departure. They charge you for every little thing. Not enough leg room if you bag is a half a pound over 40 pounds you get charged. All other airlines have a 50 pound limit. Leaving Fort Lauderdale again late taking off to MSP. Waited forever for our bags at the airport. I would never fly this airline again and would not recommend them to anyone. Low cost what a joke especially after you add all the extra charges for everything.,0
DUS-MUC-MBA and return on A330 in their Business product. Excellent value for money and good service. Friendly flight attendants with a good sense of humour in Business both a bit older and probably because of that very professional. Seats good for C-Class on a holiday carrier. Great choice of meals and excellent quality.,1
Small airline but a good one. Despite heavy turbulence on the flight from Kuala Lumpur's old airport to Tioman Island I felt safe and that the FA's knew what to do in the event of an emergency. Can't be sure of course but it felt that way. Good information from the crew about the turbulence. Small planes but comfortable for the relatively short flight. Good service during the flight.,1
Munich-Zurich on an AVROLINER with 2x3 configuration euro standard of leaving the middle seat empty. Aircraft very clean and comfortable for the 45 minutes flight. A gourmet sandwich with parma ham and Swiss cheese plus choice of alcoholic drinks and chocolate dessert and coffee. Crew polite and attentive but rushed service due to the short length of flight and stormy weather and turbulence. Zurich-Berlin Tegel on an A320 3x3 with the middle seat empty not a fan of this euro-configuration for business. Flight delayed almost an hour in Zurich due to severe storm and airport congestion. For the 1.10 hrs flight a full dinner was served in spite of the heavy rain and turbulence with fresh breads foie-gras and sauerkraut Swiss cheeses and a fruits-tart for dessert. Service was friendly by young flight attendant. Arrived Tegel in late evening with airport almost empty. Baggage was one of the first due to Priority tags. I like to fly SWISS always a high quality product delivered by friendly and professional crew.,1
Flight SQ 308 9th June 2014. The worst business Class seat too wide no support hard as a rock. You can't sit comfortably in any position and it is pathetic to lie on. My back actually aching on arrival. Never again. Food lousy choice too small service without a smile and even then only when you asked. No pyjamas SIN to London and one meal served with no cloth at all. Used to be great. Flying back Emirates and saving $1250 per seat on top.,0
JFK-ICN A380 r/t and KUL-ICN B777. Standard Asian service with mainly female crew FA. They have beautiful traditional uniform and polite service. All efficient with English. The 380 plane obviously new and clean. Many movie and TV channels but lacked channels for my six year old. Food was okay and nothing to shout about last meal was 4-5 hours prior to landing. No local drinks to sample except for tea. Seats in Economy are never good for long flights and my back started to ouch after the flight. No problems using KE again in the future if price is competitive as it was this time. Bought tickets one week before trip. Full flight from JFK 70-80% from KUL.,1
SHE-FNJ-SHE in Economy class. On the way to Pyongyang it was an old aircraft check in at Shenyang airport was smooth and check in at Korean air counter. Boarding was fine staff on board helpful and friendly. Due to the air conditioning the cabin was full of fog. There was a lot of condensation. No food for 1.5 hours flight to Pyong Yang. Check in at Pyong Yang was easy because there were not many flights at all. Departure and arrival are sharing same hall. One room for everything but very efficient. On the way back to Shenyang was new TU204 very modern aircraft. Food was served (a hamburger). Would recommend for the experience of the old aircraft (one off experience). I would fly again with the new aircraft in the future.,1
Aug 1st CZ3968 and Aug 3rd CZ3967. SHA-CSX return booked the ticket on the day of travel. In premium economy class China Southern have done surprisingly well. On this 70-minute flight they provided the warm towel service beverage service then meal service. They distributed candy before landing. Baggage arrived very fast. Inflight entertainment on this 1-year old A321 all the premium economy passengers had an individual TV. Cabin crew performed well and kept smiling.,1
"I have flown with TK a couple of times this year. The majority of flights are disappointing. Most recent flight was on 20 June 2014 from Riyadh (KSA) to Paris (France) via Istanbul. Leg 1: TK141 was delayed (as usual). Flew with an old A321. Very tired and dirty. Business class seat was an economy seat. Most of business class passengers complained about the seats (it was an overnight flight and most of us wanted to sleep - but it was impossible). Crew was ok - nothing exceptional (typical TK). Food was average - I am really wondering why they have the-so called ""Flying-Chef"" on board. Leg 2: TK1821 was delayed as well. Flew with a new A330-300 featuring the new business class. Much space and a fully flat bed. Although business class cabin is spacious it is not sophisticated at all. Cabin was dirty. Food was just ok. Crew was unprofessional and rude.",0
Premium cabin on new 717s provides access to seating in the front of the aircraft and a meal service. Value for money is okay - the fare and upgrade charge were significantly lower than for other full service airlines. If you are a Star Gold customer this is simply not worth it as you already have access to the SAS lounges. LHR-HEL breakfast was a plastic box no refinements and free water in addition to free tea/coffee provided in Economy. A very basic meal with a small portion of hot food. HEL-LHR was better with a hot meal and courteous crew keen to refill drinks. Other Star members on similar flight lengths (Turkish Aegean TAP) do a much better job. This is basic flying at the low cost end of the alliance. I have flown SAS Business/Economy Extra in the past and found service to be better the overwhelming impression is of plastic reduced cost and service stripped down to the bare minimum. The 717 is configured for 115 seats in 2x3 and not 120 seats as some have commented; there is no seatmap available anywhere. Star Gold customers are given preferential seating.,0
Cairns - Hong Kong return. My seat tray table and screen had dirt on it and a repulsive odour. Flight attendant didn't care but did give me a towelette. Food was poor. Return night flight had dreadful service no hot beverages at all. Limited choices of others. The FA walked through a couple of times only with a couple of drinks on a tray and did his best to ignore everyone. The in-flight announcements in English were incomprehensible. These planes did not have any personal airjets and were uncomfortably warm.,0
"Flying Hawaiians seasonal non stop was a pleasure. Comfortable seating, warm service and good food were the highlights of a pleasant comfortable experience. Nothing to add but a hearty recommendation. I actually prefer the older 767s over the newer A330's. Even the luggage was delivered in a timely manner.",1
Flight Ankara to Istanbul flight on time pleasant air crew bought tea and cake asked for milk for the tea and it was given very impressed with this internal flight.,1
The crew were very proud of their brand new aircraft fresh from Seattle - as per the Captain's announcement! A lovely flight to be on with friendly attentive and efficient crew. Great snacks and on time departure! Will definitely choose Qantas on my future flights to Adelaide.,1
Flew ATH-CAI-KUL (via BKK) and back. Service was good plane for ATH-CAI-ATH was 737-800. The long leg CAI-KUL via BKK is on a new 777-300ER with PTV. Meals were good planes clean price for ticket very competitive and all flights on time. Flight attendants were helpful. I will fly with them again in the future.,1
JFK to CMN. Boarding started on time but as RAM has no rhyme or reason to their boarding process we took off about 30 mins late. Slept for most of the flight dinner was above average breakfast was just an assortment of pastries/yoghurt. Arrived on time. CMN to JFK - again disorganized boarding. Left approx 40 mins late. Upon take off 3 or 4 overhead bins popped open. The passengers around me kept looking for an attendant to rush to assist since no one seemed to notice we were all scared luggage would fall on us. The attendants weren't rude just indifferent. While the aisles filled with trash and the bathrooms became filthy during the 8 hour flights the attendants did each others make up and played with their phones. Little to no leg room. The technology was laughable. Old TV's spaced too far apart and the picture quality was laughable. One movie for the 8 hr flight maybe 2 TV shows and I couldn't hear anyway since my seat didn't have audio. Overall landed 45 mins late. Below average experience.,0
The flight to Zurich costs over ??200 in economy - a destination once served by Virgin Express for less than ??00 return! This disgrace compounded with the fact that the Brussels Airlines plane is a very cramped old dirty plane!,0
Shanghai PVG - Hong Kong HKG return. After flying with Spring Airlines on several return trips between Shanghai and Hong Kong I will try avoiding this airline going forward due to significant delays (2-3 hours) which the airline didn't even bother communicating properly. Other than that Spring Airlines is a budget airline and one has to adjust expectations accordingly when it comes to service food and beverages seat comfort etc.. Opposed to its competitors Spring Airline is not offering in-town check-in opportunities in Hong Kong.,0
Having been put off using Ryanair about 4 years ago I took a flight from Bristol to Girona and return early July 2014. I was well aware of all the pitfalls and extra charges and then made the mistake of mis-spelling my own first name. I thought 'here we go' especially as I couldn't get through on the phone even the Â£1.09 a minute line. Then I stumbled upon their 'live chat' facility got connected within 2 minutes and had the name corrected. They emailed me a revised confirmation. Of the flights - well the pre-allocated seats are a great improvement - saves that awful scramble on board with the FAs screaming 'if you don't sit down we'll lose our flight slot' and passengers coming to blows. The boarding pass saying front or rear of the plane is sensible. Unlike previous flights (which was what finally put me off Ryanair) there were no cases either at BRS or GRO of passengers being harassed having their luggage weighed or measured or any sign of people being charged for things. Most notably I didn't hear any passengers grumbling about anything. So the simple impression of just 2 flights is that you get what you pay for on-time clean planes and a vast improvement from 4 (plus) years ago. Whether I want to brave a STN flight is debatable but I need to fly home later in the year and I won't be too worried.,1
Flew Sydney-HMC-London in September (inflight entertainment did not work). Returned in November (inflight entertainment did not work) seemed like this was pretty normal as none of the cabin crew seemed surprised. Wife became ill on the flight and noticing that there were very few in business class I asked if she could be moved to get some fresher air (just until she felt better) I was given an abrupt 'these seats are only for business class passengers'.,0
"We have flown Spirit airlines 4 times now - round trip to Cabo and round trip to Ft Lauderdale. After reading all of the negative reviews, I must say I was skeptical, however, they've been great. Yes, you have to read the fine print, you have to pay for your bags in advance, you have to pay for drinks or snacks on board but all in all - I've been pretty satisfied so far. They are friendly and funny. We actually arrived 15 minutes early on our flight today. The stewardess said we should tell someone because if we were late ""we'd tell everyone"". Pretty true in this day and age.",1
February 2014 flights to and from Bristol and Lanzarote. Seats already allocated so no mad rush across the tarmac and both flights on time or nearly so. Not particularly great value as I couldn't book until late on but that's way it goes. Otherwise Ryanair got us there and back as per the deal.,1
SEA-IAH first class 739 equipment. Boarding was fine and efficient. Left about ten minutes late due to catering not being available until last minute. Hit cruise 19 minutes into flight but it was fully an hour before FA served drinks. Nothing unusual going on so this was inexplicable. Service was friendly but very slow.,1
LHR-SFO. I paid premium economy but upgrade with avios so it was good value. Sat in the upper deck. FAs were attentive helpful and accommodating. A good choice of beverages available and I consumed around 3 glasses of champagne and port during my main meal. Had the steak which were okay for an airline meal. The club kitchen was pretty well stocked with sandwiches fruit chocolate cakes and champagne in plenty of supply. A light meal was offered around 90 minutes before landing I had the afternoon tea (sandwiches) my wife a salad. Some excellent warm scones were provided. I was happy with my choice but my wife thought the salad too light for a secondary meal. Overall the food was okay but I have had better on Singapore Airlines ANZ and even AA. The IFE system was dated with the screen being not as sharp as other airlines and the choice of movies limited compared to other airlines. On the return journey I slept most of the flight after the meal. My wife reported the club kitchen was well stocked contrary to some reports it is often empty on flights returning to Heathrow. A very positive note to report the BA lounge at SFO is excellent a good choice of food and drink excellent space and I loved the direct access to the air bridge.,1
JFK-GYE-UIO and back. Nice flight attentive crew comfortable bulkhead seats which where assigned to me after double Knee replacement surgery. Crews offer charm grace and hospitality. LAN could use a few English speaking staff at GYE changing planes and paying the departure tax was a bit trying since our Spanish was limited. But wherever you travel in Ecuador there is at least one Ecuadorian willing to help a frustrated Tourist.,1
"I am a frequent traveler. I booked round trip tickets for two. The first flight was to leave at 6.05 am. We loaded on time but sat on the runway for 2 hours while the computers ""rebooted"". This delay of course caused us to miss our connection flight in Denver. Causing us to miss much of the first day activities. On our return flight we made it out of LAX on time on arrival in Denver it appears that our connection flight was on time. 30 min after we landed our flight was delayed for 5+ hours. No explanation was given to us. They did give us $15 food coupons 45 min before all restaurants closed ""after we had already paid for our meals"". Every gate in the Terminal had an unused plane sitting at it. Not any cheaper "" when you count baggage fees"" than any other carrier and I have never had so much trouble keeping a schedule. There was no weather in any part of the country by the way. We haven't made it on the delayed flight yet. Entirely possible that we didn't make the 3am flight either. Avoid at all cost.",0
Travelled last week from Vancouver to Lima via Dallas on a paid business class fare. Entire experience was a huge disappointment the flight crews were indifferent seats were uncomfortable especially in the 757's from DFW to Lima. Did not get my pre ordered meal on the Lima - DFW return. As a business class passenger the Admirals Club at DFW was underwhelming. Had to pay for water. Will travel any other airline unless there is no other option. What a horrible product.,0
Totally disappointed by Etihad . Flight delayed 15 hours without notice no customer service baggage lost. I am trying to contact lost and found since 4 hours and I have not received a reply yet. Staff is not helpful and the Abu Dhabi airport did not have enough facilities to accommodate all the passengers. I do not suggest to fly with this company.,0
I flew them in June. Unfortunately my travel experience was really bad. I say this mostly as the staff were unfriendly unapproachable and disdainful. The food/entertainment/seat etc were all pretty standard although I thought it might be better than average. The rudeness of the flight attendants was sadly on each of the 4 flights I took - Melbourne-KL-Manila and return. I asked for water and eyes were rolled I told them about the headphones not working and the lady argued with me. All staff appeared tired flustered and not happy to be there.,0
LGW-UVF-LGW. Both flights serviced by Virgin's brand new A330s. Boarding for both flights was well handled by gate staff in both LGW and UVF and both flights departed and arrived on time with very little turbulence en route. Contrary to many comments I was very impressed with Virgin's new long haul economy seating as it was very comfortable with a good amount of legroom. In addition I even managed to sleep for 6 of the 8 hours on the inbound flight to LGW which was great as I usually never manage to sleep on long haul flights. Amenity kits were also given out on the UVF-LGW night flight which was a nice touch. I especially liked the new IFE system offered on the new A330s as it is touch screen operated and is also very simple and quick to navigate with a good variety of films and music to choose from. Throughout both flights the cabin crew were friendly and were eager to go out of their way for you. Furthermore call bells were answered promptly and the service felt more personal than on previous airlines that I have flown with. However the only thing that is letting Virgin down is the quality of their catering. On both flights the food portions were far too small for long 8-9 hour sectors so I'd suggest bringing extra food with you if possible. In addition there was very little to choose from on both flights unlike other four star airlines such as BA and the snack service offered on board was very limited. All in all our first experience with Virgin Atlantic was by no means disappointing and we would certainly consider flying with them again. The new A330 is an excellent aircraft to fly on as it offers Virgin's latest long haul product and is also extremely quiet compared to similar long haul aircraft.,1
Flying from Atlanta to Paris CDG in Economy. We were held on the runway at Atlanta due to thunderstorms. Not the fault of AF but where were the crew? It was stiflingly hot but no sign of water. The menu looked good but the meal was abysmal. The champagne aperitif turned out to be a choice of a long opened bottle of fizz or a plastic bottle of vin de table. Miserable staff who then disappeared until offering a low grade snack before landing.,0
LH 422 and 425. Boston - Munich and Frankfurt - Boston. Improvement in staff: kind and welcoming. On the downside the entertainment program did not offer a wide range of movies selection is also difficult as it does not have a flexible menu. Meals are repetitive for frequent flyers.,1
MIA-LIS on a quite new A330. Flight full and on time. Nice tasty meal good inflight entertainment system and very attentive crew who managed to re-launch the AVOD system as it was not working at all seats. After that ok. As usual with TAP a very smooth quiet flight. Close to landing in Lisbon a nice breakfast was served. As first flight arriving in Lisbon 30 minutes after landing we left the airport.,1
Consistently excellent. Staff always really genuinely friendly (or outstanding actors/actresses!). Food and wine good or excellent. Cuddle class is a revelation only used it once. Business fantastic but economy good too. Respond to e-mails very quickly phone support also good.,1
"Unfortunately I do not believe that China Eastern Airlines lives up to the expectations of a ""Full Service International Carrier"". Even as a cost-effective carrier they fall short of the mark in my estimations. We recently travelled to Shanghai from Sydney on MU562 and returned approximately ten days later on MU727. On the outward flight we were at least presented with an aircraft that had rear seat entertainment facilities however the inward flight provided nothing more than drop down screens and sub-titled movies. Refreshments were scarce unless you wanted Sprite Coke Water or Orange Juice. Alcoholic beverages were nigh on non-existent. On the inward flight I couldn't eat the breakfast provided as it was neither aesthetically pleasing tasty nor appetising. Seat space on the aircraft to Shanghai was much better than on the return leg because of the intrinsic design of the seat back. Service was a little off-hand with basic questions. Not an airline that I would be in a hurry to use again or recommend to anyone else.",0
Stockholm - Helsinki - (Hong Kong) - Helsinki - Beijing - Hong Kong - Helsinki - Stockholm. We tried to go to Hong Kong but had to return to Helsinki airport due to a faulty hydraulic pump. I guess this is something that can happen. However having to sit in a very hot airplane for a whole night before being told that the flight is cancelled is not very pleasant. Neither is the treatment from the ground staff more or less ignoring everyone but the business class passengers. We eventually got some help and were rebooked for a flight the next day. The flight back home was on time but the plane was very old with an outdated entertainment system and very cramped seats. Will not travel Finnair again if there is another alternative.,0
Return flight London Heathrow to Moscow Sheremetyevo. The outward flight started off good. We left on time and the plane was new and comfortable. The food is of a good standard. However once we landed at Sheremetyevo it was a whole other story. Due to weather we had to wait just yards away from our gate because there was ice on the ground. The plane was very stuffy and I think it took an extra half an hour until we finally stopped at our taxi gate. On the inward flight it was much better. Very quick and comfortable.,1
CPH-BRU-AGP in b.flex economy+. CPH-BRU excellent leg space and inflight meal complimentary bar service. BRU-AGP on B737-400 very tired interior but warm meal with full bar service.,1
I have travelled several times with Spring Airlines on the Shanghai-Guangzhou and Shanghai-Takamatsu routes. The flights have always taken off on time. The check-in staff are fairly pleasant by Chinese standards (surly by international standards) and the flight attendants seem polite. They won't ask Westerners to buy any food or drinks though. This may be because they only speak Mandarin and Shanghainese. There should be more English on their international flights than domestic ones. However English announcements are recorded so that impromptu announcements will only be in Mandarin. They advertise products consistently and very loudly for long periods on domestic flights. Given the price it is an airline that I would use again.,1
"PX4 BNE-POM 29/12. Re-fitted 767. Don't know who designed and who signed off the new economy layout but there are serious flaws. 2 toilets only for the whole of economy and they are situated mid cabin. There is no void space around the toilets so any queue just forms in the aisles. There is a seat right by the door to the toilet so this poor passenger cops the door opening and closing all flight plus the odour. Would be a nightmare seat on an overnight flight. Why is the ""latest technology"" entertainment system not gate to gate. I've had is turned on anywhere between 5 and 25 mins after the seatbelt sign was switched off and then turned off at the started of decent - 30 mins out. Result -movie not finished. Service slow mechanical. Food quite good. New seats ok for short flight but would be uncomfortable on longer haul - too hard and seat base too short -no under thigh support.",0
"Is it me or are former first class airlines morphing into 'Low Cost Carriers'? Well it certainly felt like it when travelling 'Plus' class with SAS from Heathrow T2 to Copenhagen T3 on a Thursday afternoon. Although the passenger enjoys certain advantages in 'Plus' this is lost during the actual journey. Crammed together in seats the same as economy, there was no spare middle seat, and the tight pitch revealed itself when the person in front of me reclined his seat. I mean if one is paying extra it should manifest in a more comfortable passage.",1
"Amsterdam to Prague. This once-preferred airline with above average quality of services has come to its decline and no longer deserves the 3 star rating. The airline has recently jumped on the bandwagon of paid onboard refreshments. Although I generally do not fully understand this tactics of many major airlines nowadays to make their customers to pay ""major"" airfare for low cost services I do not completely object to paying some extra for beer or wine onboard - provided that the prices are decent (which is true with CSA) and provided I have chance to get what I desire. The latter is unfortunately not true with CSA - even though I was willing to pay for a can of beer the attendant said that beer will be provided ""by a colleague"" who was however serving the rows in front of me and never made it to my row. It is quite difficult to understand the logic behind this. After arrival to Prague the aircraft parked at Terminal 1 (non-Schengen flights) which meant that although the airbridge came to the aircraft we only entered it and then we were forced to go out and take stairs to the apron to board the bus which took us to Terminal 2 (Schengen flights). This is a notorious problem at the Prague airport which the airline has be unable to resolve for 3 years (since opening of the terminal 2). The flight crew is supposed to inform the passengers in advance of this Prague ""special"" but no one bothered to do that on my flight.",0
Never ever again. The planes are not clean the staff are not friendly and the fees are unbelievable. The maximum luggage weight is 40 lbs which will render a full size suitcase overweight almost 100% of the time. Starting September 2014 they are going to start charging to print boarding passes at the airport. Relentless!,0
JFK-Bermuda-JFK. Flight to Bermuda uneventful though only soft drinks served despite being an International flight at dinner hour nary a peanut to be seen. Seat comfort was reasonable for a 1 hr 37 min flight. One flight attendant was extraordinarily rude and sassy loudly scolding numerous passengers about a number of trumped up infractions. Return flight to JFK was overbooked so we and others were hauled into an American Airlines office told we would have to be rebooked the following day. After waiting a while with no further time left to clear customs American told us to be re-booked each passenger would have to pay an additional $298 above the flight ticket already paid plus a fine. American refused even to ask if other flights (Delta or Jet Blue) had space later that day when no one was willing to pay all the extra charges to re-book on American the following morning or even tell us where the other two airlines were located. As it turned out Delta had only Business Class seats available (they said) but Jet Blue could accommodate everyone for a charge of $198 per person. American is clearly not very customer friendly and one would think twice about flying with them again in the future. JetBlue as it turned out had more leg room served a snack and their crew onboard was much better organized and politer than American had been.,0
Departure on time from Santiago to Punta Arenas. 2 stop-overs are too many for such a flight in Puerto Montt and in Balmaceda. Onboard service is fine. We asked for a blanket without any problem. Food service ok. Snacks and beverage between each stop-over. Cheep flights. Flight schedule respected. I recommend it if you allow yourself an entire day to fly from Santiago to Punta Arenas!,1
Never again! Flight out was delayed with no information. Food inedible staff unhelpful. The plane was dirty and tatty and very cramped. Turnaround time did not allow for aircraft to be cleaned and passengers rushed on board. We have a child in a wheelchair and it was very clear that we were holding things up. On the return journey only a half hour delay and slightly cleaner plane however they did not inform Gatwick that we would need our wheelchair brought to the aircraft from the hold so we had to wait on board for 40 mins after everyone else left. Again it was clear we were an inconvenience and one of the pilots went to the other end of the plane and had a smoke! We were handed stale ham rolls no tea or coffee as our meal and there was very little duty free available.,0
Began flying Frontier out of Williston ND some 3 years ago since they were the only carrier there. I live in Utah so would have expected basic but acceptable service. It seems the longer I continue flying with them the more the problems. Coming home to Utah this last time meant delay after delay (I had some 5 delay announcements sent to my email all after I already knew about it!) causing me to miss my connection at Denver. Almost had to stay overnight. Had been gone from home 3 months! How difficult is it to maintain their equipment? Always an issue for them. Now United and Delta are flying to North Dakota. I have to return with Frontier but won't fly them again. I'd rather fly someone else for $100 more who has their act together without the drama and adventure. Hope they go out of business soon.,0
This was great for a low cost 55 min flight. Flew Perth-Albany and return. Check-in was fast large baggage allowance and check-in women was attentive. Boarding call clear and we were boarded within 10min from the call. 2 flight attendants for a small Fokker 50 (prop plane) great seats with good leg room and recline. Served a meal of great food. On the way back I was surprised that there was no security check at all! What great trust the airline/airport (Skywest is the only airline to fly to Albany) has in there passengers! On the way back they served a chicken sandwich with carrot cake and cookies! Only problem I had was that it was in plastic containers.,0

I flew Air Canada a couple of times recently to Vancouver. It was a very enjoyable experience. The staff are very efficient at their work. In serving the meals they are very quick to serve as they have 4 people serving two for the meals and two later for the drinks. After the meal is done we didn't have to wait for long before they came to pick up the trays. I would take Air Canada for long haul flights. Air Canada's service is excellent!,1
January 1st Denver to Dallas Dallas to Wichita Falls. 5 hour delay in Dallas then canceled our flight. Told us no flights until Sunday/Monday refused to pay for food hotel rental and wouldn't give us our luggage. Ended up paying for my own hotel and splitting a rental with 3 other passengers. Luggage still in Dallas with no eta to get to me. 3 different calls to make a claim on luggage all three have said different information messed up my address each time and can't tell me why it wasn't delivered on next flight. Zero customer service. I will never fly AA again. I'll drive to Dallas and pay 3x as much to park my car to fly with anyone else.,0
Melbourne-Brisbane cancelled for the second time. This time at 2130 the night before an 0615 flight. I received an SMS stating the flight was cancelled and there was nothing available until Sun. Our only option would be to now buy $500 one way tickets for the family with Qantas or Virgin adding $2000 to our weekend trip to Queensland. It is a false Economy to book Tiger. You may get there but then again you may not. I have travel insurance and they can't assist me other than to pay me back for missed hotel bookings. If it's important that you arrive at your destination when you planned then book with a real airline. We've learnt our lesson.,0
I recently flew to Bahamas Feb 3rd from Toronto my first time flying with them and will be my last. On the way to Bahamas we had a 6.05pm flight which we found out last min was delayed - they said 3 hrs no explanation. Asked the Sunwing Reps and they said they had no idea why it was delayed weather was great that day. They gave us a $10 food voucher. Check in was very slow they only had 2 people working and they had to hand write everyone's vouchers. Took off a 9pm which got us to Bahamas at midnight arrived at our resort close to 2 am. Return flight also delayed 4 hrs it was scheduled to leave at 10.30 pm but left at 2.30 am no explanation at all! At this time of night the Bahamas airport was basically closed down no food or water. We were signed up to get email notifications of any delays we received nothing! Disappointing.,0
"I've been to Ireland 6 times in the last 10 years and have always flown Aer Lingus. The first time was lovely then United Air got involved and things went completely down-hill. This last trip was horrid. I don't know how anyone could find the seating even close to comfortable. I weigh around 108 lbs and was traveling with my 145 lb brother the seat felt like concrete. Like one of the other reviews I have to sit on the pillow. These retro- fitted planes are the pits. The seat in front of me was 12 inches from my nose (the screen was basically in my face.) The arm rests don't fold all the way back so you have to be a circus contortionist to get out of your seat. Two people cannot pass one another even if they're going sideways. An older gentleman literally fell into what was luckily an empty seat trying to get back to his seat. The flight attendants were pleasant enough except for one male who thought he was ""large and in charge"". The food was the usual stuff basically it was edible. My brother needs a cane for walking and were with the other handicapped to get on the plane on the return flight. Unfortunately we ended waiting 20 minutes in the cold ramp thing (can't think of the right term) that leads to the plane while cargo was being loaded. That's right cargo not luggage. Yep the people who need canes and walkers were standing around for 20 minutes. As for the entertainment it didn't really matter since I can't look at a screen that's right in my face.",0
We used Air Madagascar for four internal flights. All four were reasonably on time (max delay about 45 mins). Cabin staff friendly and good complimentary snack and newspaper on each flight. Be prepared for very rapid braking at fort Dauphin (short runway),0
Out and back from Gatwick to Dusseldorf. Both flights were very busy but the new pre-assigned seating meant there was no scrum and everything went smoothly. I have no complaints at all both flights on time and crew excellent.,1
We had an excellent experience with Air Transat - like others on this forum we were a little concerned about some of the problems experienced but we have nothing but good things to say about them. Both flights were on time the planes were recently refurbished and the staff were excellent good humored and ready to help with any request. We had seat back entertainment on the way home which was the best touch screen system I have used on a plane and makes others look clunky. A staff member at Toronto airport went above and beyond the call of duty when she got us onto our return flight when we'd been delayed by Toronto traffic - we shouldn't really have made it on but her determination saved us hundreds of pounds we'd have incurred for booking a one way flight back to the UK. Would definitely fly with them again.,1
Used them on DUB-SOU return. Both flights on time comfortable plane for the journey fairly new DH8 with clean interior. Staff a bit impersonal but perfectly capable and no in-your-face advertisement and hassling like rival LCCs. They are however quite expensive and not really a LCC at least for this route where they have no direct competitors.,1
Premium Economy from Frankfurt to Fort Lauderdale. The bad: Check-in at Frankfurt was somewhat slow and no smiles were given during the process. Boarding was a bit delayed with no explanation given. Boarding message was very hard to understand due to lousy speaker quality. We were told to board in different stages but people ignored this and everyone went on the buses at the same time. Hand baggage limit is only 6kg which is nothing (my hand carry suitcase is fairly light but still weighs 3kgs without anything in it). Luckily this wasn't checked or enforced on this flight. The good: Flight was actually quite good. Seat on Economy Premium had plenty of leg space. I'm 1.95cm and still had 30cm of space from my knees to the seat in front of me which in my case was a wall. Seat leaned back a lot which made it somewhat comfortable to sleep something I otherwise find hard on flights in general. No individual screens but a few common screens showing comedy music and ads. On the promo clips they showed for Condor all the flight crew were young and hot (probably hired models) the real crew were old and looked like something out of an 80's movie. But the service was friendly and professional. Food was actually quite good. I've had better but I've certainly had worse as well. Overall the experience on Economy Premium was like flying on the luxury class of old low cost airline. And since the price was fairly low I would probably fly this way again.,1
Abu Dhabi - Doha - Athens. All flights on time. Food was good. Stuff great as always. The new Al Hammad airport is fantastic. Very functional luxurious and far less overcrowded than DXB or ABU. It really adds to Qatar great service.,1
Sydney to London via South Korea. I was impressed by the legroom the quality of the plane (777) and the stewardesses. Toilets were cleaned every few hours more than plentiful food offered and a free 5 star stopover in Incheon.,0
"I wanted to fly LH 639, DXB to MUC. When we were ready for take off the air conditioning failed and plane returned to finger. Air conditioning was repaired, we took on more fuel then some more tests, eventually pilot announced ""doors park"" and ""flight cancelled - go back to departure gate where ground staff will take care of you"". We did, 3 ground staff had to take care to rebook some 300 passengers - a most unpleasant experience. I am sure the staff did their best but Lufthansa for sure didn't. During 5 hours wait in the queue they only offered some water inside the gate (the queue was outside), in 18 hours waiting time for the rebooked flight nothing else.",0
SYD-ICN with my elderly mother and I was very anxious and worried about our trip especially due to my mother's disabilities. At check-in after I explained my mother's situation the staff gave us the front seats to cater for my mother's leg issues. The flight attendants were very attentive and understanding and language was no issue. Throughout the entire flight (10hours) my mother and I were cared for so diligently. The flight attendants would check on us regularly and ask if we required anything. Their smiles were a great addition to the journey. I can never be so grateful of the amount of care my mother and I received. I also noticed how well groomed they were which reflects their service and their carrier in general. I highly commend and thank Asiana Airlines and recommend it to anyone who seeks a comfortable and memorable journey.,1
Definitely the last time travelling with Sunwing. Initially booked trip had us leaving on Dec 28 at 1945 hrs. Woke up that day to several notifications that flight had changed to 2300/2100/2200 and finally 2300. The kicker was receiving the text at noon that our flight was on schedule at 2300 hrs. Arrived at airport to be told weather was the reason for delay. Flight changed from 2300 to 2345. Finally left at 0110 hrs. Flight staff cheerfully turned lights on and made constant announcements while everyone was trying to sleep. Got to our resort at 0900 hrs. On last day we were advised check out at 1400 for our flight at 0235. Arrived at the airport at midnight to be told that our flight was delayed until 0510 hrs. Plane finally arrived at 0500 lined up and told flight cancelled due to mechanical difficulties until further notice. Finally on the plane at 0615 for a very uncomfortable flight. Staff were rude and unaccommodating. I was not impressed with the lukewarm glass of cheap champagne nor the food. We had trouble with them four years ago and now.,0
Flew KUL-MEL A330. First class lounge in KUL was terrible. Service OK but A La Cart breakfast horrible. Food on board was worse. Inedible 'spicy chicken' limp salad and cream cheese instead of proper cheese. Meal before landing was even worse. Undercooked pastry with unidentifiable mushroom filling. That was it. 3 bites and it was gone. MAS used to be an unbelievable product. Its Air Asia flatbeds or SQ or EK from now on.,0
Victoria - Seattle - Maui return in First Class. The service was impeccable and breakfast on the outbound flight was very good and spread out over a couple of hours which helped pass the time. Lunch on the inbound flight was equally good with a choice of sirloin steak or sweet and sour chicken. Frequent offers of alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages throughout the flights. Individual entertainment tablets with a wide range of films and TV shows. Attendants were very friendly and attentive. All the flights departed on time and arrived on time. This is the first time travelling on Alaska First Class and it was well worth the additional cost. My only disappointment was The Boardroom at Sea-Tac. It was pretty drab with a poor choice of food/snacks (both in the morning and early evening). It is certainly not worth $45 a visit. It is not a patch on Air Canada's Maple Leaf lounges.,1
SU2584 SU262 and SU271. Out April 4th back April 17th. Preferably I would never use Aeroflot again - expensive queues at every stage slow miserable long faced staff videos on board out of date food poor.,0
Rome to Poznan great flight although almost full smiling staff the pilot informed twice about the route and the weather conditions. Cherry on the cake we arrived 35 mins ahead of schedule which was highly appreciated by all the passengers. Highly recommended great value for money.,1
I recently flew DEL-SYD on a 2.5 year old 787. It was in appalling condition. The aircraft was filthy. Many parts of the bathroom were held together with tape. Service was rude when rarely present. Overall a very poor experience.,0
"IAH-SFO on A319 and SFO-IAH on B787. Comparing the 2 legs with 2 different aircraft is hard. I would look forward to more planes look like the Dreamliner in regards to age and cleanness. I have no complaints but just general concerns. Economy Plus is just the more legroom nothing more nothing less. It's the small things that can add up a pillow here and tiny bag of peanuts there and lets say a complementary cocktail on longer flights in Eco Plus to stand up to the ""Premium Eco Class"" and to be ""Eco Plus friendly. I miss the work hard-fly right slogan.",1
"Salvador - Frankfurt 29th September 2013. Flight DE 7077. The rudest airline staff I've encountered. We were travelling with four children under 5 the youngest two are twins and my husband and I had one each on our laps. First the host rolled his eyes and pursed his lips every time he rushed past us in the aisle and the children were hampering his progress. Given the size of the seats (my knees pressed the seat in front) it is normal for toddlers to stand in the aisles from time to time and he had his knickers in a knot about it even though they were promptly moved aside for him to pass. That said I couldn't understand why he might have been hurrying as customer service was zero. My son spilt water on his seat and the hosts would not give us a towel or serviette to dry the seat and so we had to sit on a wet seat for 10 hours. They would not let us change our babies into pyjamas in our seats but would also not let us go to the toilets to change them telling us we needed to wait for the seatbelt sign to go off - and it remained lit for 3 hours. I ended up very upset and having words with them about their extremely poor attitude; they said we had no legitimate complaints as ""no one else was complaining"" and it was our problem for travelling with four children (who I might add were good as gold and didn't cry once the whole time). In short travelling with a family was a nightmare on this airline and not on account of the children - I have taken more than 40 flights with my children and we have never experienced such rude obstructive and lazy hosts. We will never - never - fly with them again.",0
18 May: HAJ-SVO 25 May: SVO-ZRH. In the last month I was fortunate to travel with them twice. Both flights were consistently excellent. The food is amazing in terms of choice taste wine list and the service. I look forward to my next experience with Aeroflot business.,1
TK60 from IST to KUL in economy. Food and beverage service was as good as the food itself definitely 4-star standard. However the crew had a new trick which I have not seen before: One of the two front lavatories was reserved for crew use. It was clearly visible from my seat that the crew locked the door from the outside after they were finished using it. Reducing the number of lavatories on a plane is not a good idea. To add insult to injury the crew never bothered to clean the passenger lavatory resulting in an abundance of overflowing sewage. Wrote to the airline and did not receive any type of response. I recommend taking rubber boots on your next TK flight.,0
Luton - Prague - Luton. Snowy weather and two excellent journeys. Delayed return flight due to poor conditions and given vouchers to be used for refreshments at Prague airport - only 2 hrs delay so quite impressive. Efficient check ins and polite helpful staff on both journeys.,1
Flying 3/4 times every year since 2008 my last experience was very disappointing. Besides domestic there is no traffic during the day at Papeete Faaa airport and then late at night they schedule 3 international flights all due to leave within a short hour and this airport can't handle it. I arrived 4 hours before departure and the line for check-in immigration and luggage check were endless. I was booked on TN8 seat 11A to Paris via LAX and after pulling out we came back to the parking stand because of an engine problem. We were told it would take an extra 3 hours to change it. They decided to serve us the light cold snack. The previous times I flew we used to have a full hot meal with wine it is obvious ATN is cutting costs and service. Finally airborne 4 hours behind schedule we were expecting to be served a round of drinks but nothing on this 8 hours flight until an hour before touching down in LAX they served us breakfast. The 11 hour flight to Paris went without problem but no round of water or drinks served between lunch and breakfast. Unfortunately due to the monopoly ATN has on these routes I will have no choice but to fly with them again.,0
SYD-NAN return B744 Service. Overall an excellent experience. Crew gracious and attentive yet unobtrusive and kept drinks refreshed. The seats are showing their age but I find the old wide and padded cradle seats quite comfortable especially for short haul international flights. AV is poor - not AVOD and screens are so small. Meals were of an economy class standard but served with business class service. For the price - would do it again.,1
Took Sunwing to MBJ Jamaica Jan 26/15 and return Feb 09/15 YEG Canada. These were the worst flight experiences I've had in 35 yrs of aviation employment and extensive airline holiday required flying. They allowed a drunk to upset the flight down with loud disruptive and aggressive behaviour. The FA helped by supplying doubles to him throughout the flight. Our return trip included a very poorly padded seat with fold out of the arm table trays which made it very cramped and uncomfortable a screaming child right behind us that FA did nothing to help calm down. A diversion to YWG for fuel because of head winds. The pilot did inform us ahead that this might occur! No Enforcement of no cellphone use as we were being refuelled with passengers onboard.,0
"Hobart to Melbourne JQ714. Supposed to travel 17 October at 2240. Booked our seats about 10 days before travel ($10 fee) and got a printout. Made the mistake of not checking in when we arrived thinking the seat booking was sufficient. So after waiting 2.5 hours to board we discovered that we did need boarding cards. The supervisor then told us it was too late numbers/names had gone to the Captain and there was nothing he could do - catch the next flight in the morning. Where do we stay? Shrug. Sent us to the Jetstar desk to register for the flight and we were told we had to pay $150 late booking fee! Asked the supervisor if he could waive the fee as we had no choice but to book late. ""No can't do that."" Airport closing soon - see you later. No attempt to help or suggest any > accommodation or anything. Found some nice people who helped us find a hotel close by - $189: not much sleep. My question is: why if we've booked and the supervisor goes through the list to make up a manifest can they not make an announcement to check if people who've booked and paid for seats are in the transit lounge? Apparently with online booking this mistake does happen from time to time. Secondly why is it so hard to just call up the Captain and request the addition of 2 more passengers - who already have booked seats? It's called 'Customer Care'. Jetstar clearly don't know what that is.",0
Flew NF 30/31 from MEL-VLI on the 737-800. Nice leather seating. Very clean plane. However time for new seat cover as the leather from around the seat pocket is coming off. Foot rest would be nice but its only 4 hrs. Food was great includes potato chips (starter) salad main meal bread and a cheesecake dessert. Staff service was great (even though a staff member spilt soft drink on me). Crew member was very apologetic and provided great service to all passengers. All other crew members were great as well and very happy to sell us duty free. However entertainment was non existent.,1
July 4 to August 14 2013. Routes: Dhaka Bangladesh to Washington USA. My second trip on Saudi. Seats are comfortable even a foot rest. Economy seats are like business On many other airlines. Food was wonderful especially their snack table. I am now planning to use this for my long trip (twice a year) from Dhaka to Washington.,1
SFO-LAX-MCO on 4/24/14 and return on 4/30/14. Overall good flights. Friendly attentive in-flight crews. Seats are comfortable enough for me. I believe they are slightly larger than on many other airlines. There are enough free entertainment options (Direct TV music) to keep me happy. The only problem encountered was not Virgin's fault - the Air Traffic Control system went down in Los Angeles on 4/30 and screwed up everything. Our 9.30pm departure from LAX to SFO ended up leaving at 1.35am. It would be nice if the FAA would get their act together.,1
Recently flew Birmingham to Keflavik return. Prior to the outbound flight I checked in online and moved our seats to 10a and 10b both of which are in the Economy Comfort area and offer a little more legroom than standard Economy. There was one drinks run and one duty free run. The selection of films was adequate for a 2.5 hour flight. The return flight was onboard the specially liveried Hekla Aurora which was nice as it was due to do the run to Gatwick that day. I again had checked in online and obtained exactly the same seats so the return flight was just as comfortable. I enjoyed using Icelandair and certainly would again if I was flying to north America from BHX rather than travelling down to London. One tip though is that if you are checking in online definitely get yourselves into the Economy Comfort zone and in particularly rows 8 if you are travelling as a couple or row 7 which is just behind Saga class and is very quiet.,1
Round Trip Flight MPM-NPL-MPM. Boeing 737-500 To Nampula and back With Embraer 190 To Maputo. Staff kind and helpful food nice and seats comfortable. Only 2 disadvantages: tickets are really expensive and delayed in Nampula more than 1 hour inside the aircraft.,1
LGW-REUS-LGW. We flew with our 2 grandchildren last month. Check in was relatively easy and we were airside in approx 25 minutes. Boarding was OK although there was some confusion with the wrong passengers sitting in the emergency exit seats which caused a delay and resulted in the pilot saying unless it was sorted out in 2 minutes we would miss our slot and would incur a 2 hour delay. This did the trick and after a rapid push back and taxi we were airborne very quickly albeit 25 minutes late. The flight was uneventful although quite noisy with happy families and kids looking forward to their holidays. The return flight was the same although we departed and arrived bang on time. Overall good holiday flights with friendly and efficient cabin crews and as a result I would have no hesitation in recommending Thomson Airlines.,1
Took four LAN short haul flights on 767 A320 and A319. Very impressed with flights IFE and service offered. On one flight from Mendoza to Buenos Aires I experienced my first missed approach and must commend the pilots and crew for their professionalism during some anxious moments. Passengers were kept well informed in both English/Spanish. LAN are not that far off Virgin/Qantas levesl for short haul although they could improve their inflight snacks through having the chocolate dominated boxes at more appropriate times.,1
5/4/15 SMF-MSP Airbus A320 Economy Comfort legroom adequate service competent. Complaint: Delta does not post economy comfort fares on its website but as separate upgrades for each flight segment. Value for money rated at 1 because I traveled on an award ticket entertainment rated as 1 because the flight didn't have any. Legroom was slightly better than on previous Economy Comfort flights but recline was still minimal. Food for purchase was unappealing but the complimentary snacks and beverages were acceptable. I wouldn't recommend Delta because it seems to focus more on nickel and diming its passengers than in providing quality service.,0
"Flights on time both legs, good service from the cabin crew. Thought the seat width and legroom was actually quite good, better than some charter companies used previously. My only gripe was the ridiculously long queue at the bag drop desks at Bristol. What's the point of checking in online if you've still got to stand for an hour just to drop off a suitcase, they needed to open far more desks. Other than that, I couldn't fault them.",1
Reserved and paid for regular Air Canada round trip Toronto to Puerto Vallarta last year for travel this April. Wound up on Rouge with a person with a dog in a carrier under the seat next to me. This left no space for the passenger's legs so he took part of my space which was tight enough already. When I politely asked for another seat I was told there were none. I walked the length of the plane and there were seats at the back. No entertainment tablets for $10 that did not work mushy sandwich and knees in my back. Thanks but no thanks - no more Air Canada for me. Rouge me once but not twice.,0
"Simply atrocious lack of service and responsiveness. On Friday 5th Sep I was in Hangzhou expecting to catch the 16.20 flight to Singapore allowing a 25 hour connection window to an SQ flight. At 10.30 am got an SMS advising a 2.10 delay so I'll miss the connection. I called my travel agent in Australia and asked him to find an alternative. I was quite willing to drive to Shanghai and change onto SQ 17.00 flight - it had seats. I was given the complete run around by Silk Air directed to three different phone numbers with no one willing to act. Next I got my secretary in Hangzhou to try she got the exact same outcome. After about 6 calls over 3 hours time had run out. I took the original flight and missed the connection. At Singapore at midnight SQ gave me a hotel voucher for the Conrad and told me to take a taxi. The taxi queue was at least an hour long. I would have had a couple of hours sleep before needing to get up and return. At the SQ desk I swapped this for a much more logical bed in the ""pay by the hour"" mini hotel in T3. Why wasn't this offered in the first place? Why do I have to ask? Silk Air A320? I had a seat in 2nd row avoiding the 1st row - that has too little leg room. There is in no power point despite being a 5 hour flight so my PC battery ran out. No in-seat video so no alternative entertainment.",0
Economy class on 28 Aug from London (LHR) to New York (JFK). Boarding was in Terminal 5 which I love as I can sit for some time in Caffe Nero have a coffee and watch airplanes take off or land. I choose BA just because of their Terminal 5. Boarding went quite smoothly and the flight was full. It took about 40 minutes till we actually took off after the time we were supposed to. The seat I had wasn't comfortable the cushion was moving and the seat wasn't firm. The inflight entertainment had a limited choices of movies which was disappointing and the screens were small and sometimes were not working. Flight attendants were all women who were polite and smiling they did their best to make it a pleasurable flight. Toilets were clean. The headphones were broken and I had to ask for new ones. We landed on time. It took 15 minutes till the plane could park and then another 30 minutes to get off because as the captain informed us there was a long line at immigration and we would have to wait for them to give us the go ahead. Inside Terminal 7 there was a huge line it took 2.5 hours to finally reach an officer. This was by far the most annoying and tiring experience I have had. To land at 10.45pm and get out at 2am is just too much. I will now choose an airline that lands in a terminal which can handle large numbers of passengers more effectively.,1
Jakarta-Narita-Jakarta on B777-200 aircraft Economy class. There was no delay for either outbound or inbound flight. Cabin was so-so clean tidy and nice inflight entertainment was okay. Meal tasted very nice cabin staff were very deft and courteous. The only downside from the flight was the air conditioner felt pretty warm on CGK- NRT sector some passengers including me told the FA and problem was fixed afterwards. The other was Tokyo- Ishigaki-Naha-Tokyo with B737-400 and B747-400. No delay overall flight was so-so just a little disappointed when there was no hot meal for Tokyo-Ishigaki and Naha-Tokyo service which is a quite long domestic flight.,1
Geneva-Istanbul (A319) - Istanbul-Kuala Lumpur (A340-300) on August 6th-7th 2013. Flight from Geneva to Istanbul was smooth nothing special. Flight from Istanbul to KL service-wise was flawless and seamless. Very attentive service needs were taken care of before you asked and very good food although I have had even better food on other THY flights. My real issue is with the business class seat sleeping comfort on the A340-300.I am not sure at what angle the seat reclines but it is pretty nasty I was annoyed because the ticket price was pretty high. I wonder why Turkish a forward looking airline as using the A340-300 on the IST-KL run with this seating arrangement in business class. I just hope that Turkish will either change the planes on the IST-KL run or do something about the seating in their A340-300.,1
LAX to Narita (with 2 hour layover) and then to Incheon. Economy seats had a pillow blanket headphones slippers toothbrush and toothpaste. I had the window seat. The seat itself was pretty roomy able to stretch my feet below the seat in from of me. The food was great for a plane meal. There were about three options for each meal. They serve tea and coffee after each meal. Entertainment was great! Overall I was very satisfied with the service. They spoke good English and Japanese! They were very polite from start to end. Never failed to smile!,1
Having read reviews I was rather worried about our flights from Antigua to Tortola and Tortola to Barbados. However flights were on time staff very pleasant and our luggage arrived with us.,1
We visited the Middle East in May 2011. Before leaving New Zealand we made bookings with El Al (via the Web) to fly Tel Aviv to Cairo. When we arrived at the airport to check in for the flight El Al staff informed us that the flight had been cancelled. They arranged for us to fly to Cairo via Amman with Royal Jordanian the same day but we are cross that they didn't bother to inform us of the cancellation. The booking was made in September 2010 and they had an email address to reach us at.,0
Flew from Birmingham ZB458 Feb 20th 2014 to Lanzarote and returned on March 20th 2014. Cabin Crew on both flights were superb particularly on return flight to Birmingham where there were 9 disabled passengers on board including myself.,1
"I've been flying world-wide for more than 50 years with many different airlines. Despite many online complaints about Ryanair my experience with this airlines had been very good until my flight from Malaga to Venice (Treviso) on May 6 (FR 2597) when an incompetent female flight attendant and a very rude belligerent male maitre d'cabin (both Malaga-based) changed my perception of the airline. The maitre d' shouted and yelled and my son who expressed his concern regarding fresh air and cooler air temperature in the cabin. Ryanair is a budget airline and I'm aware of that but budget does not mean poor maintenance and rude and unfriendly flight crew. As a very frequent airline passenger I must point out that there are more and more budget airlines in the world and competition for the passengers is tougher every single day. Ryanair cannot keep playing the silly game of ""We're cheap so we can afford everything and if you don't like that go somewhere else."" I guarantee you that we will.",0
DUR-JNB-HKG. Ground staff at Durban were great giving me the emergency exit on a brand new A320 plenty of leg room and friendly staff. Upgraded to business using Voyager miles while in JNB airport for the Hong Kong leg got row 3.The ground staff in JNB are usually unfriendly and unhelpful but this couldn't be further from the truth on this trip. Awesome service from them. Then from the moment we stepped on board the crew couldn't have been more friendly but as always very safety conscience. Updates from the flight deck are always good on SAA and this trip was no different. We were well informed and warned in advance about bad weather. Food was good and entertainment good. The lie flat seat was great and I slept for 7hrs. Woke for breakfast and landing. The flight crew let me into the cockpit to take photos and went out of their way to explain all the goings on in the flight deck and gave me the weather print out as a souvenir.,1
Flew Antigua to St Maarten with a stop in St Kitts. Flight out was on time and return delayed just over 1 hour but kept well informed by ground staff in St Maarten. Ground staff and crew were very pleasant in both Antigua and St Maarten. Flight was expensive but they have a monopoly on most routes so they like most other airlines take advantage of that. The aircraft's were old but sufficient for the short hops they do. Overall a good experience and baggage arrived no problems.,1
I fly to the oil rigs all the time and I've never had such a poor and frustrating service. Eastern airways are consistently late and they never tell you. I really hope another airline comes to Aberdeen to provide a professional service the price Eastern Airways charge they should be embarrassed of they service.,0
Flew JFK-BOG-GRU on an Avianca's A330 and other then the fantastic fare appearance of the aircraft and warm attitude of the crew it is not worth flying Business Class. The seat is extremely uncomfortable if you try to sleep and the lack of international standards in service makes you wonder why didn't you fly coach! Again the crew cannot be nicer but their disregard for the basic concepts of business class service could be amusing if they did not include things such as not picking up glasses before landing and the way they serve meals.,0
"Flew Thai Smile from Bangkok to Macau and back. Nothing to smile about considering its an International sector. Seats good for Thai""s anyone above 5'7 will find it very difficult to sit in. Food comes in a plastic bag - a bottle of water a small pudding a tiny sandwich. In spite of clear weather in Macau a day after Typhoon Usagi spared the area flight came in 3 hours late and further delay to land as only one runway operational in BKK - another 40 minutes late missed my connection to Krabi rude staff at airport refused to change my ticket to the next mornings flight until I complained. Sat at the airport for 14 hours. Thai Smile in the Land of Smiles for once didnt make me Smile! Never again.",0
SIN-PER-SIN. Both flights were on time we paid to choose our seats (basic ones) and got them. We filled our bottles with water prior to boarding and carried with us some burgers and snacks. Although they announce that food purchased from outside is not allowed to be consumed many people have a bite and no one says anything - I would recommend this option over purchasing the inflight food especially as many people have said that it is not good. We watched our own movies on our iPad so entertainment wasn't an issue either. Safety measures were taken very seriously and the cabin crew were responsive when they were called for. I would definitely recommend this airline it does what it says on the tin and at a very decent price. If you want all the frills and creature comforts beyond a nice seat safety and being on time don't go for it.,1
QF23 SYD to BKK 14 Dec. Personable interactive cabin crew led by a formidable CSM (he even kept us personally well informed on the state of play in the Ashes match at Perth with a PA report for the whole plane on landing) quality service interesting and varied lunch menu complimented by great Australian wines and served at a leisurely pace. Boarding at a remote stand by bus and stairs hardly QF fault says more about the airport management than the airline with a personal and friendly greeting at the door. Slight delay in push back but kept well informed by flight deck crew. QF at it's very best only sour note was touch screen IFE not working.,1
Travelled from Shanghai to Heathrow following an excellent first leg also in Premium Economy from Auckland on Air New Zealand. The Virgin experience was very disappointing by comparison. The plane was old and shabby (I saw one passenger trying to mend the tray compartment cover on his seat it having fallen off) and the toilet in Premium Economy was out of order. The seat was cramped especially when the seat in front was reclined making it no easier to get out of the seat than if it were in Economy class even though I am a small person. The flight attendants especially one were flustered unfriendly surly and unhelpful - when I pointed out that my headphones were not working I was made to feel as if I were being a nuisance by requesting a working set and there was certainly no apology. In over 40 years of flying this was my first time with Virgin and I shall not be repeating the experience. I especially resent the extra paid for Premium Economy on this journey.,0
JFK to LHR. Empty check in and priority security quick. New food selection in First class lounge but preferred the decent meal in the dining room. Boarding easy and upper deck crew excellent as lights not turned on until just before descent with arrival on time. Bus to terminal but bags waiting when we got there.,1
Flew Business from London to Perth and thought the overall experience was good. The seats were better than I expected after reading this forum and the service staff on my flight were all polite and helpful. Food was excellent. The only main negative point was that the inflight entertainment was rubbish compared to what you get on other airlines. A real disappointment especially when flying long haul.,1
OSL-IST-AGP return February/March 2015. OSL-IST on B738 aircraft. Flight more than 80% full. Cramped seating in economy. I moved to a row of 3 vacant seats were I could sleep after the meal service. The same applies for the AGP-IST sector on B738 aircraft. IST-AGP on A321-200. The aircraft seemed brand new. The flight was almost 100% full. My seat was in an emergency exit row and so the legroom was very good. The same applies for the IST-OSL sector A321-200 aircraft and seated in an emergency exit row. I had the option to travel for a slightly lower fare non-stop with Norwegian (from Gardermoen airport) or Ryanair (from another Oslo airport not Gardermoen) but I had to be at Malaga at a determined time of the day and when you factor in the luggage Turkish Airlines was then the most reasonable option. In addition the friendly and efficient staff the service standards catering in-flight entertainment and onboard comfort on Turkish Airlines (apart from seat pitch) were top notch. The duty free shopping and dining opportunities at IST airport were an added plus. I definitely recommend Turkish Airlines.,1
LAS-SFO. Probably the best domestic business class flight we've had. From the ground service to the service in the air everything was good. Food was great as was the IFE.,1
London Gatwick to Buenos Aires (via Madrid) 4.5 hours late with no explanation given at all. Air Europa changed my return flight by 3 hours -again with no explanation. Flight was in the early hours so left in the airport with no ground staff from Air Europa at all. The service is appalling. The planes themselves are not set up for long-haul. Many of the seats do not recline nor do many of the screens for on board entertainment work. You have to pay for headphones or bring your own. The food was beyond awful and the air hosts could not tell me what the food was (it was hard to identify and I am not a meat eater). I was told to 'just try it or leave it not their responsibility to know what the food was'!. For me the most worrying element was the lack of safety. We descended and landed with the air hosts standing up and chatting. Some of the overhead lockers were not shut and passengers were not asked to have seats upright or tables put away. Seat belts were not checked at any point.,0
Flight from YYC to IAH in Executive Class was just OK. Food was horrible but the flight service director did his job well. Flight from CUN to YYC in Executive Class was one of the best flights I've been on. The food on this segment was much better but what made is so great was the cheerfulness and helpfulness of the flight service director. Drinks were always topped up and staff made sure everyone was comfortable and asked if there was anything else they needed even though it was a full flight. A pleasant surprise from Air Canada.,1
LGW-MLA. At the risk of sounding like a record stuck in a groove this was the fourth Air Malta flight in two weeks which went very smoothly and efficiently. Check-in at Gatwick was instant and the revamped fast track facilities were as they should be. Plane left on time and arrived 15 minutes early. Service was friendly. Only gripe is that if you are sitting in row one there is nowhere to put ones bags as the overhead lockers directly above them are used by the crew necessitating stowing the bags slightly further down the plane which is a particular nuisance when disembarking.,1
22nd Jan Leeds Bradford to Alicante. Booked window seat for my husband with no window very uncomfortable seat. Booked for food online had to keep asking when this was going to arrive. Did not find service very good.,0
First trip from Brisbane to Kuala Lumpur via Brunei. Extremely good value for money crew are attentive and ensure you are well looked after. We travelled with a disabled child and the service was great. Stop in Brunei can be tiresome.,1
Flying an old worn out 767 from Auckland to Honolulu and back. Yes the pilot got us where the ticket said we were going I'll them credit but felt crammed like sardines the entire time. Cant comment on the food as we had seat only plus bag though if you want to go for 8 hours without food or movies good luck getting sleep in these seats. Also should you choose no food or movies you get treated a bit like a second class citizen by some of the staff members. Ground staff lounge staff were good.,1
MEL-AKL-MEL in J Class. Wonderful service on both sectors with a really varied and friendly crew on each sector. Staff were oblivious to the call button on the return leg the bight little light above my seat didn't attract anyone's attention which I found quite grating considering how professional these crew were appearing to be. The seats were extremely comfortable and although perhaps not quite as comfortable as some airlines lie flat fold over beds for sectors like this they were great. The scrambled eggs on the breakfast flight out of MEL were very disappointing and quite solid but a small grizzle. The dinner on the AKL-MEL leg was exceptional the best steak I've had in the sky! The bar at the back is a great feature it was packed coming back into MEL. For this reason I'd avoid sitting in the rear cabin the noise would be too much on a long night flight. Only real (yet again very minor in the scheme of things) complaint when our jackets were handed back as we started to descend there was nowhere to hang them around the seat. They had to lie crumpled on our lap or draped along the bins at the side. A hook in the seat back would be so handy. Would recommend anytime and aside from the couple of small complaints a perfect way to fly. Well done EK. SQ have lost themselves a regular traveller.,1
If you regard Air Berlin as a low cost carrier this is the best you could experience in this segment - planes are clean and pretty new. You get good attention onboard and a snack plus a soda or juice for free. On the ground however the experience is different. They are really overdoing it with baggage weight I find it a sure way to turn a loyal customer - holding the Frequent Flier Card - off by making a big fuss (happened twice) when the baggage weighs 215 kg instead of 20 kg. Terminal at Berlin Tegel Airport lacks seating which becomes pretty inconvenient if a lot of delays occur at the same time. If the price difference is not more than 10-15% to a regular carrier like LH or CX I would probably pay that and choose them instead of Air Berlin.,1
London-Bangkok return TG911/910 19/12 and 17/01. Refurbished 747-400r with mini suites offering more privacy than the older open plan style. Excellent service throughout on both flights. Food perfectly ok if a little dated although I loved the pre-booked menu for the return flight to London including a Thai style duck curry. I much prefer the older 747s to the A340 in first as the latters cabin is much smaller and uses the older seat style. London Heathrow was a joy in the new terminal two where we use the United Globalfirst lounge. BKK Royal First ground service excellent as always. Probably my last trip on the 747 as the A380 is being introduced from July 2015 although this may lead to the reduction of the two daily flights to one only.,1
AUH-LHR on B777. I was asked by the cabin crew to change my aisle seat to a middle exit row sea with another pax. Wish I hadn't. The exit row seats while offering leg room are very narrow. The snack pack offered on the early EY11 departure was sufficient just before sleeping. The pre-landing breakfast was OK. It was a shame one isn't able to use the great IFE gate to gate.,1
SÃ£o Paulo - Rio de Janeiro / SDU to Belo Horizonte return. 2 airplanes offering very nice comfort for a truly low-cost Airline. The other B737-300 offered average comfort showing a bit of real age. I paid only 60USD for the return flight - a quarter of the price of the competitors. All flights in time except for the CFN-SDU one delayed for an hour.,1
LHR-DUB. A lot of passengers nearly missed the flight due to the screens in the terminal saying it was delayed by one hour only for the departure time to go back to the original at the last minute. Then with all the delays finding passengers the flight was running late only to be told we'd have to sit there and wait for 15 mins. Ended up taking off at the original delay time. Two different reasons given which was a bit odd. Comfy seats but an astonishingly bad menu selection.,1
On a flight from Glasgow to Toronto May 25th this aircraft was full to capacity. I had a window seat although I preferred an aisle seat. I never once left this seat on this 6.5 hour flight it was next to impossible to get out move up the aisles with service carts. Could not read a paper as passengers crammed into me could not stretch arms wanted something out of my pant pocket. forget it no leg space cramp's. For the amount of money we pay and have that nightmare of a seat is unacceptable and even if I wanted to purchase duty free that I did not try getting a credit card out of your wallet I would have to ask the other 2 passengers centre and aisle seat to stand up so I can move.,0
Dec 7th flight from Montevideo Uruguay to Madrid Spain (12 hour flight): I was very concerned when I read reviews after purchasing my ticket. However I must admit the boarding process was efficient the plane was very clean and my vegetarian meals were above average in terms of airline food. The gate personnel and flight crew were very attentive and courteous. After a pleasant trip I reminded myself that a good review was in order given all the negative reviews I had read. Yes I would recommend this airlines and hope to fly them again in the near future.,1
ORD-BUF - a short hop on American Eagle and a very decent experience. Check in was fast and efficient and I was told I would be better off checking in my one bag on the airbridge which was very helpful. Boarding on time and I settled into 1A. It was nice to have some extra legroom at the front and not a problem being opposite the tiny galley - the crew member relieved me of my carry-on as no underseat storage and was prompt in asking if I needed it after take -off and also in returning it at the end. Flight left on time - plane was clean and we arrived ahead of schedule. Bags were quickly returned to the airbridge on deplaning. Overall short but very sweet experience.,0
"YYZ-MIA on a 737-700. Flight left and arrived on-time. I enjoyed the ""First Bag Free"" policy which brought much pleasure to me. The PTVs are a nice addition but it's not supported in southern U.S airspace although free movies were played. The staff were great and the snacks were another perk. Overall great flight!",1
12 Dec 2013 Flight EK004 from LHR. Staff on Emirates flight from London to Dubai are getting worse. They ignored both my children (5 and 8 years old) no toys. They did not have the ordered meals for the children. Head steward claimed I had not ordered them but I had proof that I had ordered them. These are A380 flight crew - what is the point in getting a new flight when the staff cannot meet the basics needs of passengers.,0
Flight from Florence to Brussels total chaos.  Half the passengers were not allowed to board as according to the captain they did not have enough fuel and needed to reduce weight.  All luggage was offloaded and so none arrived in Brussels. Still waiting as there is only one flight a day.  When SABENA was alive most things went wrong but no one understood why.  With SN they tell you why but it still goes wrong.,0
Rio de Janeiro-Sao Paulo. Brand new Embraer 195 with personal screens on every seat and live TV with a broad selection of movies sports channels and news. Cabin crew is friendly and well-groomed. Flight time was 55 minutes. Snacks (cookies chips and pretzels) along with water juices and spirits were distributed free of charge. Announcements and safety information/instructions were held in Portuguese only: in my opinion they should be in English too. Overall a nice experience. Ticket fare was very low considering the peak season (beginning of February). I usually fly TAM for domestic flights within Brazil but as of now I will consider Azul as a valid alternative option.,1
Flight JQ151 SYD to CHC on 12th March - seats 5 A and B. Great check in at SYD polite and friendly staff no queues and all done with smiles and a minimum of fuss. Two bags checked in and no issues with weight or size though one was on the button and the other just under. Flight on time and the seat next to us was free bonus. The cabin manager was on his game polite friendly welcoming and very smartly turned out. The other crew equally so and the atmosphere on board was one of calm and professionalism. Smooth take off not a word from the Captain but prompt service one we levelled off and again swift friendly and professional. Given the hour of the flight the Cabin Manager was smart enough to realize that most people were wanting to doze and there was minimum noise and disruption from the crew in respect to announcements or endless trips up and down the aisle as sometimes mysteriously happens on night flights. Arrived early into Christchurch and left the aircraft with a heartfelt thanks from the crew and a cheery good night. Great flight from Jetstar - this is our fifth International service and all are up there with the mainline carriers at about a quarter of the price.,1
Arrived at Dubai DBX at 18.15 for 21.45 on 10/10/14 flight to Perth to be told flight was over booked we had been travelling through Europe for eight weeks and had a stop over in Dubai. I was very surprised to hear we had no seats having booked the flight nearly 12 months in advance. We only managed to secure seats after we explained our daughter was flying overseas on the 11/10/14 and we would not see her for 3 months. We have travelled with Emirates several times because of the quick connecting flights to Europe but intend to look at other airlines operating from that area in future. We were very disappointed they way we were treated by Emirates on the last leg of our journey home it was the only blemish of our holiday.,0
Very friendly staff in the airports and the plane. Planes clean and comfortable - only two seats per side. Web site good. Free snacks/sandwich and drinks for economy. Planes are turbo prop but modern and appear well maintained and running three flights a day from St. John's to Halifax.,1
"During check in on a flight from Madrid to Barcelona our carry on luggage was checked in without measurement or weight checks. The cost was 35 Euro per bag while our tickets showed the price to be 25 Euro. On purchasing the tickets all the ""free"" seats were taken and we were required to pay and additional 4 Euro per seat. Once on the Airbus 320-200 empty seats were available throughout the entire cabin. Why this airlines is rated anything other than 1 star is bewildering.",0
Darwin-Perth via Kununurra and Broome. Light food and beverage served on each leg by friendly and hard-working cabin crew. Aircraft interior trim was a bit worn but the seating was the most generous and comfortable I can remember in an economy cabin anywhere ever - this is how it should be! All up the flight took nearly 6 hours and we had to stay on the plane during stops but I would have had an expensive extra night in Darwin had I flown with anyone else. I got a very good fare booking well in advance but fares shot up to over $800 a week before - perhaps they should review this pricing policy because the plane was less than half full on 2 of the sectors.,1
Nickle and dimed! We were trying to fly from PA to FL on the cheap so we went with Allegiant. Big mistake. The base fare may seem inexpensive but they charge extra for everything (carry-on +$30 pick your seat another +$30 drinks snacks $5 etc.). The flight attendants were cranky and rude! My husband is tall and he has a bad knee so we paid $32 extra to reserve his seat in the emergency exit row (more legroom). I was led to believe that I would be seated next to him if possible. Not so. I checked-in on-line exactly 24 hours before the flight and was seated on the opposite end of the plane. Just before take-off we noticed that the seat next to him was empty. I politely asked the flight attendant if I could sit next to my husband and she rudely barked that I could not sit there as it was an exit row and I hadn't paid an extra $30 to sit there. I quietly returned to my assigned seat. If you're thinking of flying with this airline just be sure to calculate what you're actually spending (after baggage fees picking seat fees printing boarding passes fees getting a drink of water mid-flight fees etc.) and be sure to factor in dismal customer service as well.,0
QF52 SIN-BNE 31/8/14 - Singapore lounge was well maintained but busy with the atmosphere of a pub in many parts. Cabin crew were very attentive and helpful and very friendly - Qantas leave other airlines out in the cold when it comes to cabin crew service in business class. Unfortunately the business class seats on this A330 were angled which aren't as easy to sleep on compared to proper lie flat beds. The inflight entertainment on this flight seemed very dated but it was an overnight flight so wasn't a major problem.,1
Business class SYD-LAX. Excellent flight roomy cabin. Lie flat bed. Turn down service a nice touch enhanced by the pyjamas. Food tasty and the option of ordering breakfast selection prior to settling down for the evening was great with breakfast served when at your preferred time. The sit down bar provides a great place to relax. Inflight entertainment is easy to use and provides a good choice of entertainment. The crew provide a professional level of service with a relaxed approach. Only complaint would be the seat which can be hard in the fully upright position. Not having the entertainment screen not located in the seat in front works as it enables the screen position to be adjusted. Overall recommended for long haul product.,1
You think you're getting a great deal on flights until the night before when you go to check in. There you find that you have to pay $45 to carry on a bag both to and from per person. Not only that but hopefully you have a printer on hand because if you have to print at the airport it's an additional $10 per ticket. That doesn't seem like much of a deal to me. In the end we could have traveled with a more spacious airline without all the hassle and without an unexpected $180 charge.,0
I flew on October 5th then on to Mykonos. I then flew to Athens and then to Kos. On the 16th from Kalymnos to Athens and back to Mykonos and then on 22nd Mykonos - Athens - to Irakio Crete and then from Crete back to Athens. I must say I have had some excellent flights with Aegean. All flights on time and an excellent meal from London to Athens and this being Economy. On the internal flights you were offered a soft drink and snack. Cabin crews were extremely professional and I look forward to next October. The only downside is that: 1) They did not show any films or music available on the London flight and 2) When I booked in March I could not book the November flight home because tickets were not available so BA flew me home. I knocked a point off their food and beverages as they don't serve a gin and tonic in Economy. AS I have said I look forward to flying with them next year but they have changed the flight times to Mykonos from Athens from 7 pm to 6.30 pm which makes life difficult so they might lose this customer.,1
We recently returned from a holiday in South Africa. We flew Qantas on QF63 returning on QF64. Prior to travelling I tracked every flight to see what type of aircraft and what configuration we would be likely to get. Knowing that the run is 100% 747s I documented the age Registration number and name of the aircraft used for 96 flights. During October you were more likely to be flying in one of their oldest planes average age 23 years. 57% of flights which meant that if you were unlucky you got one of these and as we were flying Business class the cabins were still angle flat beds. As I have a bad back I really wanted a full flat bed and you guessed it we got an old plane. Coming home on November 4th we got lucky and were on a younger aircraft with the A380 configuration and full flat beds. We were up in the bubble both ways. The older aircraft have 24 up top the younger models just 18. A big difference with space a bit tight on the older 747's. Since Qantas switched the Sydney Dallas run to A380's the pendulum has swung and you are now more likely to get a newer 747 with re fitted cabins. Aircraft - 5 out of every 7 flights now being the lay flat A380 cabin layout. If you are in the bubble be warned the newer planes have just one toilet upstairs in Business where the older 747's have 2.,1
"The flight, when everything is working, is good. Spirt handles disruptions very poorly.  I flew Minneapolis to Boston through Chicago. I signed up for email notification from Spirit Airlines and I checked my email before leaving the house to the airport ??saw a notice of a delay in Chicago. Got to the airport and noticed the flight had been canceled. I asked about why no email notification, they said the flight was just canceled. They booked me the next day out (the only option!). I showed up at the airport the next day (again I checked my email ??no notice) the flight was delayed ??3 hours! (they had to wait for the last flight attendant). At the airport I pulled up my reservation on the web site (manage travel) and found my flight was routed to Fort Lauderdale ??Myrtle Beach ??Boston. (again no email notice of route change!). Finally left Minneapolis 3 hours late and arrived Chicago. I could not find a service counter and all the gate counters were busy loading people. I finally grabbed a person and mentioned that I think my flight reservations had changed but I had no boarding passes - he did finally find my rerouted arrangements and printed boarding passes. Got on a plane with only 20 other passengers, the gate agent mentioned that the airline scheduled a new flight just for us! We got to Fort Lauderdale one hour after the flight to Myrtle Beach left (so wouldn?t you think the airline would have known that a special flight taking off when it did wouldn?t arrive in time to connect with the outgoing flight). There was 14 of us in the same situation (trying to get to Boston) and were told to go out of the secured area and talk to the supervisor at the ticketing desk. We all had to wait in line with customers checking in. We finally got a service rep that set us all up with hotel and food vouchers for the night and some were scheduled on a morning flight to Boston and some, myself included, were scheduled out at 8 pm to fly to Myrtle Beach to connect with a flight to Boston getting into Boston Thursday AM. The 3 of us that were on the evening flight asked to be put on the standby list for the morning flight out. We got to our hotel at 11pm and we signed up for a hotel shuttle at 5am the next morning. We (the 3 of us) got to the airport Wed. morning and were successful in getting a seat on the 8:50am flight to Boston which went well. A side benefit of being on standby is that all 3 of us got exit row seats ??more legroom. We got to Boston by noon Wed. So my trip: MSP ??BOS  Monday am to Wed noon. I did call Spirit and they agreed to move my return flight out a few days without charge since my flight had been canceled.",0
"I travelled from Singapore to San Francisco only because it was a codeshare flight with ANA (from which I booked my tickets). Inflight entertainment was decent on the 1st leg of the flight to Tokyo presumably because it has just been upgraded with touch screen high resolution screens. However inflight service was horrid if you would even call it service to begin with. Flight attendant lashed out when I returned my tray (I was back from the restroom returning to my seat and thought it would be convenient for us both if I were to hand the tray to him since he was collecting the trays 2 rows before mine). ""Can you please wait"" with absolute annoyance and utter look of disdain before grudgingly snatching the tray away. The same flight attendant stepped on a pillow (which fell from a passenger's seat) while pulling the trolley and conveniently kicked it aside to the bottom of the passenger seat without a bat of his eyelid. On the food expect the same food you'll get from a low cost carrier. In fact you'll be better off with just cup noodles. It was the first time I have seen attendants hand out food without giving you the option to choose simply because ""we ran out of xx option so this is your only choice"". Inflight service was scarce no one bothered serving water after the meals and before flight landed. On the 2nd leg from Tokyo to SF there was a huge screen in front which they call inflight entertainment. You have the option to pay a nominal sum for wifi access and watch the movies from your own smart devices. Food was as poor as it can get for an international airline with poor service all the same. Rude attendants were still present but I was spared from any lashings this time round (the lady in front got reprimanded for the most ridiculous reason). I asked if I could make an inflight purchase 4 hrs before the flight was scheduled to land and was told the attendant in charge was resting. 2 hrs later I asked the same question and the same answer was given. Just when I decided I am not going to let United earn another cent from me that flight attendant finally finished her break right before the plane commenced its descent and asked what I would like to get. Do note that the ratings were made when comparing against the inflight experience I had when I took Cathay Pacific and ANA flights from Singapore to SF earlier this year and last year.",0
I flew from Chicago to Atlanta. The plane was full the staff very nice and friendly. My only complaint: the cabin was filthy it needed attention and the seats were small I'm a big guy 6 ft and 220 lbs. The flight was a short one if it had been longer it would have been uncomfortable.,1
"LAX-MFR via Portland in first class. Both flights on time. Staff very professional. The ""light meal"" seemed rather skimpy since this flight took place around dinner time.",1
Sullen attitude of cabin and ground staff who decided that honeymoon couples and teenagers warranted upgrades to the first class cabin after the aircraft was changed following a long delay despite us having contacted special assistance weeks before as my husband has terminal cancer and needed easy access out of his seat. If you have ever seen the ridiculous layout of seats in business class with BA where you have to step over someone else's bed you will understand my point. Loos out of order for almost an hour in the dated overcrowded lounge where other than some apples and oranges there was no food for over an hour. The food on board was below mediocre. At Â£5.500 for 2 tickets the seats were uncomfortable with a threadbare blanket and misaligned footstool. The business lounge in Bangkok had threadbare carpets uncleared tables and stale croissants.,0
Flew from Newcastle to Palma and return last summer delayed both ways miserly 5 euro voucher for 8 hour delay. Staff off hand to the point of rudeness catering poor seats dirty cramped seating. Wouldn't use them again.,0
Flight Hong Kong to Zurich. A night flight and so the sleeping position was a key test. The seat makes up into a fully flat slightly narrow but very comfortable bed. The seat layouts are unusual and I was in the K rows which are all single window seats. The shelf and storage spaces are much better than many business seats and the table for meals also large. Meals were tastefully served by smiling staff. Excellent value for money.,1
Flew to Tel Aviv from JFK. Purchased Economy Plus Seat for $149 (One Way). Had more leg room but seat was very uncomfortable. I'm not obese but large enough that I felt like I needed a shoe horn to get into and out of the seat. Foot rests were useless. Was in Row 1 - no overhead storage. Fiasco getting my luggage at arrival. Crew speak very softly on microphone. Aisles are so narrow because airline is packing as many passengers onto aircraft as they can. I heard complaints about legroom in Business Class. Not worth extra investment I'm told. Eleven hours is a long time to be cooped up in such a tiny seat. Return flight was better but passenger comfort is not a priority for El Al. Security was fine. Most of the staff were very pleasant and fine. I would try another airline next time.,0
My flight to Paris departed from Beirut at 2 am flight was on time. I could not sleep because the seats were rather uncomfortable. However the in-flight entertainment was amusing and up to date. Service was fine. Takeoff and landing were extremely smooth. The food was okay nothing special. Cabin crew friendly. Luggage was on time. I would not think twice before choosing this airline.,1
BKK-ICN. Delightful as always. While on the ground before the flight I went to the spa for my massage - truly a plus offered by TG for premium passengers. The crew was gracious and the flight was most enjoyable. The A330 the seats do not recline 180 degrees but I was able to sleep nonetheless.,1
MAN to FUE return. Outbound on brand new A321 with new style sears. As a 6ft 4 male the leg room was great and the flight was excellent. Only issue was the constant sell but this is the norm now. Return on an old a321 with old style sears. This was really tight and the sooner they revamp them the better. The crew did really well considering a passenger was taken ill. Overall not a bad experience.,1
There has been consistent daily delays to Molokai. I have waited in the commuter terminal for 3-4 hours to get on a 15 minute flight to Molokai. I see that the same aircraft is going back and forth between Honolulu Lihue and Lanai and Kapalua but when the delays piggyback the Molokai flight will be pushed back to accommodate the passengers on later flights to other destinations. Customer service podium is empty with no notification of delay until you look at the flight board. We can see the customer service personnel on the ramp laughing and chatting with co-workers they show no concern for all the passengers in the terminal waiting for someone to come in. When you finally get a hold of someone and ask them what's the delay they say its due to the late arrival of the aircraft. We were delayed 3 times because management changed their mind on where the plane should go. It was announced that when our aircraft comes from Lihue it will continue on to Molokai however when the plane lands they change their mind and inform us its going to Lanai on time. This causes us to be pushed back 2 more hours. Don't get on the new planes they cant land on Molokai and Lanai with more than half a load of passengers. It takes 3 times longer to board and unload. I don't recommend Island Air.,0
"Auckland to Christchurch return on A320. Flight to Christchurch Koru Hour flight meaning alcoholic beverages and Cheese and cracker or vegetable crisps served. Bags out quickly at Christchurch. Flight to Auckland biscuits or vegetable crisps served along with tea/coffee or water. Bags out after 25 minutes. Seat room pretty good. However for the very tall, could be issue. Flight fast lasting about an hour in both directions. Seated in 23F and 23A respectively. Good value flight for the duration.",1
Dalaman to Manchester good value for the money. Safety Information shown on screen was good. No entertainment but did not bother me as it was an early morning flight. They sold beverages and snacks on board a packet of Nescafe white instant coffee and hot water cost 3 Euros. 4Euros for a can of lager or soft drink. 3 Euros for a bottle of water. Cabin Crew seemed pleasant. The leg room was poor in Row 11 so could not get comfortable for sleeping. Airplane seemed in good condition and modern.,1
8th Aug 2014 London Stansted to Dusseldorf AB5825 and then 9th Aug Dusseldorf to Cancun AB7416 and return 23rd Aug Cancun to Dusseldorf AB7417 and Dusseldorf to London Stansted AB5826. Really good long haul cross Atlantic flights kind and helpful at staff check-in and for in-flight service. Good meals with drinks brought round in between. Planes seemed new with fresh seating and USB ports on the media screens. The short haul Stansted to Dusseldorf parts were delivered by Etihad Regional and again good in-flight service. The only slight negative was the time to check in on return they opened it 1.5 hours pre flight and completed 45 mins before the flight with only about 30 people in line the slowest check per person I've ever known. However Dusseldorf airport was lovely and smart for the wait time between flights. Avoided US Immigration hassles/poor customer service by flying Germany to Mexico.,1
London to Kuala Lumpur via Cairo one day after Heathrow was re-opened. Original departure time from LHR was 1400 but delayed until 1900. No Egypt Air ground staff to be seen at all. No updates on why our flight was delayed or whether all of us will be able to catch our connecting flights in Cairo. Outbound journey from LHR to Cairo using new Boeing-777 impressed with entertainment system but food was horrible. I do have to give credit when we arrived in Cairo they made sure that all transit passenger flights will be waiting for us. There were many passengers flying to Johannesburg and Kuala Lumpur from London on that flight. The final leg to Kuala Lumpur was awful. The aircraft was an old Airbus no personal tv. The toilet doesn't seem to be cleaned at all. No comment as well with the food. Overall it was a below average experience flying with Egypt Air.,0
July CPH-FCO-CPH in a B-737. Clean cabin comfortable seats with good leg room for a person of medium height. Cabin crew sufficiently polite and effective - considering the budget flight context - food and drinks are on the expensive side but then again catering was never 'cheap' even the days of complimentary meals! Boarding was slow due to passengers with oversized hand baggage often needing help with stowing it in the overhead compartments! Norwegian should tighten their hand baggage policy. Otherwise: a very favourable first impression of Norwegian!,1
Recent trip Seville to Paris. On time. Clean plane. Friendly staff with good English. Excellent seats near emergency doors,1
Flew LHR to Toronto. Food was fairly good as was drinks service. Crew moderately friendly but not overly. Didn't look like they enjoyed their jobs. Legroom was good in economy. Boarding was good. Check in at LHR all self service and decidedly rude staff who would be better employed actually printing luggage labels etc than offering blunt and rather patronising advice to confused passengers. IFE is decidedly 'yesterday'.,1
Gatwick to St Lucia return. This was our first time on the A330 in what I think they call Upper Class 2. Definitely not as comfortable as the Upper Class seats on the 747 and A340-600 aircraft. There seemed to be numerous faults with the seats not converting into beds and VV without manual assistance. Virgin need to improve their Upper Class seats considering those offered by their competitors. They might get away with it across the Atlantic but not travelling East. Food and drink was good and also good service.,1
NUE-DUS-CUR Return. Dash 8/A330-200. Air Berlin has a good product in Economy Class. Good IFE for Long haul flights. Seat Comfort and Pitch are acceptable. AB seems to hire a rather mature Cabin Crew. This translates in a professional cabin service which is not always friendly per se. Main issue is the provision of refreshments on the IC flights. Two meals are provided;1 warm meal two hours into the flight and the second cold (and small) approximately 60 min before landing. This was the same for in/outbound. This means no refreshments or snacks for approximately 6-8hours!! So BYO! In addition make sure you select a low row number 1-35 rows in the back of the aircraft cannot select meals and get whatever is left. Meals are rather poor in quantity and quality. Note that AB is a semi-LCC though with mostly regular fares. This could explain the poor Food and Beverage service. Flights were all remarkably on time.,1
AI143 from CDG to DEL. Departure on time. 787 service with IFE in economy although with limited choice. Choice of 3 entrees (Fish Chicken Vegetarian). Nice and very efficient cabin crew. Overall a good night flight.,1
"Flew LHR-BRU-ABJ return in December on business class on way out flight was operated by FlyHi of Portugal without very low standard of business class old plane poor staff no in flight entertainment but at least some additional legroom and reasonable food. On return at check in was told ""business class not up to usual standard"" so I assumed it would be the same as outward leg. On entering the plane (again FlyHi) I found it was all economy. I am surprised Brussels Airlines don't have one spare plane to operate the service!",0
I thought they did fine until it came time to leave Cancun. The bus trip which was also organized by Air Transat was only supposed to take an hour and a half which ended up taking 2. After being late to get to check in I was told that I would have to either return to the back of the check-in line to remove my camera bag or pay $30 extra. I was told they would not check my luggage if I attempted to remove anything at the counter. When I questioned their logic and explained the situation with the late bus I was given a sneer and a sassy comeback. So all in all it left a bad taste in my mouth about them.,0
Just got back from a TC holiday from Cuba. We flew from Manchester to Cayo Coco there were no premium option available on the flight as it is the new A330. However as someone with dietary restrictions I was appalled. I ordered a Gluten free meal but clearly their catering department cannot be bothered other than providing a gluten free roll. The side dishes are usually given in a separate box. My OH has desert cheese biscuits etc. In mine one gluten free roll that's it. Nothing to replace the pudding. Tea time came and once again the food was served. The cabin staff could not be bothered firstly looking up who had ordered special meals so was firstly given a pack of sandwiches and a box again with something sweet. On correcting them they delivered mine. No alternative for the sandwiches instead a box with a gluten free roll and a banana. Nothing else. The return journey wasn't much better.,0
Arrived from London with my fiance. We bought tickets from their website and purchased preferred seats for an extra hundred dollars only to end up sitting in completely different sections of the plane. Our advance purchase had not been logged into their booking system. Our problem isn't that we couldn't sit next to each other but the way in which we were treated by the Singapore Airlines staff. One particular male check in staff blatantly displayed annoyance at us and showed no signs that he was willing to rectify the issue. We gave in and just decided to sit in whatever was assigned to us and after a promise of a refund for the preferred seating we were dismissively waved off. Started off badly on the ground and continued in the air when we were bypassed during meal service and one rude staff wasn't interested when we questioned her. A senior crew noticed this and was professional in trying to make up for it but by then we were fed up at the inadequacy and total lack of customer service.,0
"DUB-Bristol UK. Even though we preselected seats and paid those extra fees I couldn't get the check-in process to work online. We arrive at the airport and promptly are charged 420 Euro (6 ppl) to have them check us in - the original trip only cost 380 Euro! The front desk person told me I had 30 days to check-in and that the reason the flights are ""cheap"" is because of the online check-in. So let me get this straight 6 pieces of paper that wouldn't even cover a letter-sized piece of paper and the 5 minutes of their time is 420 euros - about the weekly pay of these folks? Unbelievable.",0
I flew with Turkish in January in C-Class Vienna-Istanbul-Bangkok and Singapore-Istanbul-Vienna. Its true that they offer good amounts of food but the quality was poor on all these sectors. Completely tasteless meals served by flight attendants that did not smile at all and did not understand English. The cabins of the long sectors IST- BKK and SIN-IST were also quite dirty. The most disappointing thing was that the crews on all the sectors were not very friendly. Austrian Airlines also have Do&Co as their caterer but between Austrian and Turkish there is a big difference.,0
April 15: Cape Town - Doha- return Brisbane - Cape Town May 2 2015. Cannot fault this airline standards are kept high on all sectors. Bought ticket online when Qatar had a special 40% discount!,1
Travelled on CX358 from Manchester to Singapore via Hong Kong that should have left on the 29th. The airport experienced some delays due to snow and was closed for a while. I have no problems with the delay as you can't help what the weather brings however we were boarded onto the plane where we sat for 6 hours going nowhere. Cathay have their own infrastructure in Manchester airport supplied by Airline Services who simply couldn't cope with the amount of planes that needed to be de-iced. Cathay did little to keep us informed and when the flight was subsequently cancelled we got off and put up in a Hotel in Manchester for the night. The following day we did eventually leave but the knock on effect of the delay was now felt by the flight when we arrived in Hong Kong there were no connecting flights and the ground staff were overwhelmed with trying to get us all sorted out so spent another day in HK airport. Yes the planes are comfortable the food was quite good as were the facilities but their being able to work under pressure was very disappointing and frustrating also they do not accept the fact they could have done better.,0
Flew Dragonair in June 2013 from HK to Okinawa Japan and vice versa. Flight was delayed for around one hour for both sectors really could not recommend this airline. Though its rate charged was not 'budget' in any way the flight certainly felt like a Budget flight - you had to ask for cushion and blankets there was no inflight entertainment for the 2.5 hours flight and food given was below par.,0
I flew recently with UIA from Berlin via Kiev to Bangkok. All worked really well. If you inform yourself in advance you are aware that there is no real entertainment program and that they charge for alcoholic drinks and non-alcoholic drinks other than water juice and tea/coffee. So there is no reason to complain about then for informed travellers. Anything else is fine also long-haul: seats are comfortable space might be even more than average 2 meals are served water and juice can be ordered during the whole flight for free all flights were on time planes are safe. It must be for the missing entertainment program that UIA is just ranked as a 2-star airline. I would fly again if they have competitive prices (what they had this time to Bangkok). All in all recommendable.,1
Day trip SIN-KUL on relatively new aircraft. Given the short distance AirAsia is definitely worth the value paid. Uses Terminal 1 at SIN but LCCT at KL is not the best.,1
Flew March-April 2013 - 7 times during a 3 week trip including round-trip from LAX-Shanghai and 5 trips within China including Hong Kong-Shanghai (round trip) Shanghai-Beijing Beijing-Xi'an Xi'an-Chengdu. None of the flights were on time. All of the food was pretty bad (even for airplane food standards) and all the in-flight entertainment was outdated. We did have one recent American film shown but it was a 1.5 hour flight so they cut it off before the ending. They are quick to warn you regarding turbulence and flight attendants are plentiful responsive and apologetic. Speaking of the meals the entree is always a meat/brown gravy rice or noodles congealed mass. Best meal was the Chinese breakfast of yoghurt fruit and pork and chicken dumplings. Drinks/Soft drinks are frequently served but beer/wine if at all available runs out quickly. Also an FYI regarding switching off your electronic devices approaching landing - they initiate this process 30-45 minutes before you actually land. Seats were pretty standard for economy but if the person in front of you reclined the pitch was so that it made your tray table unusable.,0
We were disappointed at the decline in standards. Since our last flight the standard and quantity of food has reduced. On both outward and inbound flights the main meal was chicken on the return chicken in curry sauce with dried up rice. Previously free wine and beer was available this is now a thing of the past and we were only offered soft drinks. On the outward journey the cabin crew seemed disinterested the crew on the return were more customer friendly but were speaking to each other over the voice of the captain giving messages. Cabin crew uniforms are dull and appear old fashioned. Regretfully the whole experience was disappointing and not what we expected of a schedule airline.,0
Recently flew Gatwick to Hurghada. Check in was great as Easyjet take up what seems to be an entire check in area of their own. Our hold bag was slightly over but the check in lady kindly ignored this. As we were travelling with our young daughter we boarded ahead of other passengers which allowed us to get settled without holding other passengers up getting things into and out of bags. Service during the flight was great announcements were adequate and we landed ahead of time in Hurghada. I am 6ft 5ins and found leg room to be fine. Sure you can't stretch out but it's fine for the duration of the flight. I really liked what seems to be new seating with thinner more comfortable padding. All in all another good experience with Easyjet.,1
Very good first experience on MAS SIN-KUL-KIX on economy and return on business. Check-in at SIN was fast hassle-free and baggage was released timely at KIX airport. It was an overnight flight on New Year's Eve and clock struck 12 a while after take off so pilot wished us a Happy New Year and we happened to be able to see fireworks in the distance from our windows. Refreshments (a tuna croissant and drinks) were served about 45 mins after take off shortly after cabin lights were dimmed for pax sleeping. Lights gradually turned on (instead of a flick - from total darkness to instant brightness) and breakfast served 1.5hrs before landing. Took the Nasi Lemak set and it tasted pretty good. Check-in at KIX was done really swiftly (less than 10 minutes) staff was courteous and welcoming. Did not get to use the lounge as I was running late. Seats reclined comfortably duvet was soft and comfortable. Drinks and nuts served before flight took off. Food commenced shortly after flight took off. Appetizer was Beef and Chicken satay too much sauce for me but delicious nonetheless. Next up was the soba + mini sandwiches + smoked salmon/chicken breast appetizer. Main course was beef tenderloin. Dessert (I requested for it to be served 2hrs before landing) was a slice of pie/cake with blueberry sauce. I had a good rest on the 8hrs flight to KUL. Flight attendants were attentive and smiley. Would definitely fly MAS again if I have the chance.,1
GVA-CAI-BKK v.v. New 777-300ER on the long-haul - a real improvement. Very comfortable lie-flat seats in business fairly good IFE system a big step forward. Staff service seems to be improving too. On the way back it seemed like a number of business class seats were occupied by MS staff. Food - main course tasty while the first course seemed to be the same on every flight. They tried to give priority boarding for business passengers in Geneva airport but not well organized. Transfer at CAI airport the same as usual passing by the transfer desk even if already holding a boarding pass for the onward flight. Lounge ok flights on time. GVA-CAI-leg served by 737 as usual with still fairly good business class seating (2-2-configuration). All over not bad for the money paid.,1
Traveling out of New Orleans Louis Armstrong airport for business around 2 pm on 3/5/14. Baggage check was totally disorganized. I was directed to a kiosk by one of the agents then waited 15 minutes after I had checked the bag electronically for someone to come and tag it. When an agent showed up to tag the bag they were clearly not in a hurry. Then my flight was delayed. Maybe there's no rush at check in because United flights are late so often.,0
I had two short hops between IEV and DOK. Planes brand new ATR. Seat pitch is so so no recline. Overall comfort level was ok. They served a snack which looked uninspiring so I skipped it. The free bar service only consisted of soft drinks. Flights out and back were on time. Considering very reasonable ticket prices will use again for flights up to 2 hours long.,1
We flew Vancouver to Guangzhou and then to Kathmandu. The first leg was an old plane. Our overhead lights wouldn't turn off. The video on the seat in front had only one English language film and the picture quality was poor. Service was nothing to write home about nor was the food. We left 2.5 hours late which meant a rushed transfer in Guangzhou. The second flight to Kathmandu was better on time and a newer plane. However several passengers (including us) had to wait a nervous day for our luggage to arrive on the next flight. Luckily it did but could have been a real hassle as we had travel plans in Nepal the day after the luggage arrived. Yes the fares are cheap but I don't think I would use this airline again. I forgot to mention the lack of legroom for anyone taller than 4 feet.,0
SUB-CGK using Boeing 737-800 aircraft. Departed late but arrived on time at CGK airport without any baggage trouble. In-flight meal is adequate for short route travel. In-flight entertainment is good as always however the headphone needs to be repaired soon for the next flight services - one side is off. Will travel again with Garuda Indonesia in the nearest future and hoping that Garuda will use its renowned Airbus A330 or Boeing 777 for one of the CGK-SUB vv services soon.,1
Flew CGK-HKG-JFK-HKG-SIN on the 8 Oct and to Singapore on the 12 Oct. Overall experience ok. Seat comfortable. Food slightly disappointing. Flight was on schedule. Entertainment nothing to be excited.,1
We flew Scoot Biz from SYD-SIN on 5th of Jan and found it a very comfortable flight. Cabin crew were very friendly and attentive. I read up beforehand on their website that IFE wasn't available on their IPads so I brought my own so that you can just live stream movies from their system. Seats were wide enough and recline was ok for a sleep with very good head rests the only complaint is there is no space between armrests so it's just like in economy where there isn't enough room for your arm and the person next to yours. Only 1 drink and meal included but the beers were reasonably priced at $4 AU but water was expensive at $3AU. Flight was on time and check in a breeze through the dedicated Biz counter. Boarding was good with a separate biz boarding so we were first. Pilot was down to earth and entertaining. It was definitely the most comfortable flight I've had to Singapore and will travel with Scoot again.,1
Flew from Dusseldorf to JFK. A330 service in Business class. I often fly BA Virgin and Singapore Airlines transatlantic. I have to say I thought Air Berlin were just as good (admittedly SIA use A380's on the JFK- Frankfurt run and are a little roomier). I thought the seat was very good (I was in 2A). The food was good and the entertainment system was good although I think Virgin wins that one. Flight was on time despite a big headwind. I will definitely fly them again and love the fact I can avoid Heathrow and use my Avios points.,1
BNE-CAN 5 Dec 2013. CAN-BNE 1 Jan 2014. CZ381/382. The plane was very modern and the seats were very comfortable. The inflight entertainment was alright with enough movies to watch for 9 hours. The food is what you'd expect from economy class. The overall experience is positive as there was a smooth connection to domestic flight which was a nice time to get some sleep. Mixture of Chinese and Western passengers. CZ canton route seems very popular and it's not hard to find out why. Hard product 10/10.,1
August 21st Paris to Minnesota aboard AF 340-300. Flight delayed an hour because of a problem with the air- conditioning. Once again we enjoyed the larger seat and extra leg room. I especially like the option which allowed me to raise the seat front to support my calves. When dinner was served; my choice of chicken was quite good while my husbands choice of risotto was not good at all. Flight departed at 1.50 pm the lights were dimmed after dinner to enable passengers to get some rest. Attendants came through 3 or 4 times offering snacks and ice cream as well as additional drinks. The entertainment options were exactly the same offered on our previous flight. Once again we did not need the blankets so we sat on them which compensated for the hardness of the seats. My only complaint is the handling of our luggage. One of the advertised benefits of booking and paying for premium economy is to have your bags tagged priority??which is supposed to insure prompt delivering upon arrival. As I stated our flight was an hour late departing therefore we only had 45 minutes to make our connection in Minnesota. We were traveling with friends who did not opt for premium economy. We both checked in at the same time. Upon arriving in Minnesota our bags which were tagged priority were definitely not delivered in a timely manner. In fact many non priority bags arrived long before ours; including those belonging to our friends to flew economy. As a result we barely made our connection (2 minutes) our bags did not.,1
Yes the last couple of comments about REX are 100% correct. I fly with them up to 2 return trips a week from my regional NSW home so feel I am in a position to give an accurate and impartial view. The check in service at my regional airport and Sydney is outstanding the friendliness of the staff and the on time departures and arrivals(usually) is outstanding compared to the other players in the market.,0
Cheap cheap cheap. Golly how expensive would it be to let people watch the TV news on an all-day plane ride or allow 'free' Wi-Fi which is free everywhere else in the western world? A few snacks anything? Had a lovely cheerful flight attendant between San Francisco to Newark but all the airline nickel-and-diming takes all the fun out of what used to be half the fun: getting there-or back. It's as though they hate their passengers and make the trips as miserable as possible seats too narrow for a normal rear end aisles two skeletons could not pass in no place to put your legs if you have two seats that recline an inch and a half charges for even a small bag everything. Back to cars and trains or staying home I think it is just too exhausting and annoying and expensive to fly anymore.,0
Had to opportunity to fly Sun Country for the first time and was very satisfied with the airline. Sun Country provides audio entertainment with either your own L/R adapter and your headphones or they will provide you one for $1. Some services cost extra but are reasonable. Costs: Can of beer (Miller or Bud) $3 Harder drinks (Like Long Island Ice Tea) $5 Traveler pillow and blanket (Yours to keep) $5. Sun Country is one of the best when it comes to the budget airlines much better then Ted or Air Tran and the service was very friendly. The only problems were the lack of staff at MCO and how the tickets and boarding made you think you were flying Delta. Also the audio entertainment (All 8 channels) repeats every hour. Otherwise the staff helpful and friendly and flight attendants are first rate.,0
We just returned from a trip to Cabo San Lucas from San Diego on Spirit Airlines and we will never fly Spirit Airlines again! To begin with their website is probably the most poorly designed website I have ever seen. You may find a cheaper ticket to wherever you are going - but check the fine print! You must pay for baggage including carry on and it is not cheap. Nothing is free when you fly - you pay for water soda snacks - they give you nothing! There is no entertainment and the flight attendants are about as useless as hang nails. Our flight home was delayed 3 hours the customer service at the ticket counters are not very helpful - its a good thing we enjoyed our week in Cabo because getting there and returning home was a nightmare! The seats in this airplane were disgustingly dirty old and torn - do yourself a favor - never fly Spirit!,0
BRU-BKO return - Economy. 7 hours delayed arrival due to unforeseen schedule changes. Oral apology given not really acceptable for 7 hours delay. No vouchers no miles no meal provision as a token of apology. I tried this flight option because it is the newest airline to be added to Bamako and the cheap fare is what you pay for - cheap service! No VOD old seats and apparently a day trip to Ghana and Benin on the way to Mali.,0
I just returned from a flight from Chicago (ORD) to Tampa (TPA) for spring break. I made a reservation that was non-stop both to Florida and returning home. I'm handicapped and was traveling with my 7 yr. old grandson. The flight to Florida was fine leaving and arriving on time. The flight home was a different story my flight home was cancelled during the night and I was booked on a flight that left 40 min. earlier with a layover in NJ. for 2 hr. then another plane which we had to sit on for 30 min and leaving late. I called and explained why I needed a non stop flight I was told the only non stop plane wasn't leaving until 3 days later. This meant instead of a less the 3 hr flight it was a 7.5 hrs. I was unable to get any help from management customer service.,0
Poor airline - pulled away from the gate then a passenger wanted off - she ran up to the front and wanted off the plane. So they pull back to the gate and delayed us 1.5 hours. On return back to Chengdu from Thailand boarded plane and our seats were taken by others. When we advised the stewardess our seats were taken she forced us to take a seat at the very back of the plane. After 10 mins of arguments we got our new seats at the back of the plane. Advise all foreigners not to use this airline.,0
Wonderful service in Vancouver Sydney and Auckland airports. Inflight entertainment and food were excellent. Cabin crew very friendly and helpful beyond call of duty. My wife required wheelchair due to injury and ground staff wonderfully attentive. The best in the business by far.,1
SLC to OKC. My spouse gave me her first class (upgrade) boarding pass. I can't comment on value for money because this was a free ticket. However first class was disappointing no food served or available for purchase on a flight that boarded at 1:20pm. (we had a one-hour layover). The seats were wider than those in EC and with more legroom. I'd fly Skywest again but would not pay for a first class ticket. Other than the lack of food the flight was pleasant the FAs attentive and courteous.,1
Pre-paid for seats as we were travelling with a 4 year old and needed to sit with her at Stansted they called Priority and Pre Booked seats on first on returning from Perpignan they did not call pre booked seats. On checking our tickets we noticed a * against Other Queue - does this mean you have paid for pre-booked seats? Neither ground or aircrew knew what it means!,1
CMB-HKG. This looked like the oldest plane I ever travelled on. An A340 which was in a shabby condition. To my surprise all seats had entertainment screens but that 5 inch screen looked like the old television sets of seventies and only 4 or 5 video channels and 5-6 audio channels. The seats were old but spacious as its configuration was 2-4-2 which is rare in newer widebody planes. It had plenty of leg room. The food was average to poor. On first leg CMB-BKK they served breakfast with juices. On second leg BKK-HKG they served lunch but no drinks. The lunch was as bad as the breakfast. No special meal request taken care of. Hope they improve the food services although I find the onboard staff courteous and helpful.,0
WX 185 London City to Amsterdam Shiphol on 7th November 2014. We took CityJet for the first time to fly to Amsterdam as the departure was from City Airport but I would have preferred travelling from Luton airport as it would have saved me so much time and money. Indeed we had to give our cabin luggage because the flight was too busy but few people that were coming late could have kept it even though their bags were probably larger than the acceptable cabin sized luggage as they could not be bothered. They said they would check what they can do as we did not want to leave the luggage but they obviously never came back and I ended up arriving late to my business dinner as I had to wait for my cabin luggage to arrive. The flight itself was a nightmare as the plane was very old so very noisy and uncomfortable. Never again!,0
Kansai-Sendai. Lovely new planes with wide leather seats attentive cabin crew and easy self check in at both Kansai and Sendai airports. Great value for money much cheaper and quicker than the train. Will definitely use Peach again.,1
I had a great experience with Aeromexico on a round trip from Las Vegas to Guadalajara. The aircraft was very clean. The loading process was efficient and quick. The flight attendants were very professional and all were bi- lingual. The entire staff of Aeromexico were pleasant and concerned with customer satisfaction.,1
Sydney to Seoul then Seoul to San Francisco both flights in business. SYD-ICN - Seats were padded nicely and comfortable and are electronically adjustable to various positions. Food and wine fantastic and looked as good as it tasted. Overnight stay at Incheon Airport Hotel was superb. ICN-SFO - Business lounge in Seoul was clean and modern and a comfortable facility to relax in with fresh but limited food. Lounge staff notified me of my flight and guided me to the gates where business pax boarded first. Onboard seats were even better and newer than those on the first sector. They were fully flat beds in which I managed to sleep for 8 hours. Food wine entertainment once again excellent All attendants attentive and ground staff were excellent.,1
Flight was fine but the check in was appalling I got charged a fortune for a second piece of luggage - a camera less than 6x4x4 - but women with much larger handbags were allowed to take them on the plane in addition to their cabin bags. Customer service dreadful - utterly useless - and there is no Easyjet UK phone number.,0
LHR-IST-DAC. LHR-IST in cramped A320 rushed and poor service with cabin crew having very poor English skills. Crew forgot to serve our row and when this was pointed out was shown palm as she was 'busy' and would deal with it when she had time. Finally got meal served 45 minutes later than other passengers. On arrival at Istanbul TK ground staff showed indifference to questions asked about the complimentary 'TourIstanbul' offer for long transits indicating I would have to find out at my own initiative if I could avail it and that they would not be able to provide any advise! Ataturk Airport is busy but has a good selection of duty free and some nice lounges. IST-DAC on leased Meridiana Aircraft. Terrible flight poor service. However flight departed on time and arrived early. I had no in-seat entertainment console/remote as it had been ripped off its place I assume hence was unable to view inflight entertainment - did not miss much it was only 5 channels of not-so-new movies. Cabin crew were lax with security and the service was very poor. TK takes pride in their 'Turkish Hospitality' but I found the hospitality of theirs quite poor to be truthful. I certainly will not be flying with them again. TK is no competition for the likes of EK QR or even BA for that matter.,0
"We were originally going to book our vacation package (6 adults 4 kids) through WestJet because Air Canada Vacations did not have a package to the Marina El Cid. The travel agent offered us the option to book our flights with Air Canada then book transfer and hotel separately. We were very happy to choose that option since Air Canada was recommended as ""the best"". On Feb 18th we flew to Cancun on Air Canada Rouge and will never fly Rouge again. We had a 4.5 hr delay due to mechanical issues. We arrived at the airport at 5.30 am for our 8.30 flight. Between 6.43 am and 7.42 am the departure time changed 4 times. (11.00 12.00 13.30 and finally 13.00). We rec'd a $10.00 food voucher per person which we all know does not get you much in an airport. A sandwich and a drink was min $12.00. Not long after take off my sister in law went to the bathroom and came back to report that it smelt. The inflight entertainment system is a joke. The leg room is so cramped. We did receive a promo code for a discount on a future booking no idea how much of a discount but will probably never use it as it seems that all flights to sun destinations are with Rouge so disappointing. Hopefully when we are ready to book our Feb 2016 family vacation (10-12 people) Rouge will be gone and Air Canada Vacations will be a contender again.",0
June 12th Finnair flight Helsinki to Hong Kong flight was abruptly cancelled (ie 8 hour delay) and we were rebooked on the Singapore flight losing our pre-paid exit row seats in the process and greatly inconveniencing my return to work the next day. Rebooking agent was rude. Worse I know these cancellations are a matter of routine - same happened to two relatives in May. Finnair apparently cancels flights when they do not sell a minimum number of tickets. I fly 60K miles a year but will never ever fly them again. And good luck trying to get your money back for pre-paid comfort seats.,0
I just had a short flight from Casablanca to Marrakech with Royal Air Maroc Express and the overall experience was good especially considering the bad reviews I had previously read. Check-in in Casablanca was friendly and helpful.,1
Travelled from Dusseldorf to London Stansted booked as Air Berlin flight but actually it was Etihad Regional operated by Darwin Airline. I could not book the seat in advance and were forced to wait at the airport until check-in counter opened. Flight was stated as delayed by 40 minutes but actually this was more than 60 minutes with very few announcements. Flight itself was comfortable SAAB2000 is unique aircraft with one seat on one side and two seats on the other side of the cabin which I like. Fortunately I sat on one seat which was good for me. As it was an evening flight they gave a bread snack which for a short flight is fair. As I like this aircraft maybe if I have a chance I will take this flight again however I would not recommend to my friends.,0
ADL-DXB-LHR. My first time flying with Emirates and enjoyed the journey Boeing 777ER. Check-in was quick and efficient as was the boarding. We were seated in row 19 AB for the flight to DXB. Nice and comfortable seating the in flight entertainment is excellent as was the food and service. We arrived in DXB on time and had a 2 hour layover before our flight onto LHR. The LHR leg was on the A380 in row 43AB. Once again boarding for us was quick and efficient the flight was smooth and the cabin service very good along with the food and beverage. Arrived in LHR on time but would have been earlier as we were held up by ATC. A great experience with Emirates and will definitely fly again.,1
"I was flying from Miami - Sao Paulo on AA929 on the 10th July 2014 on a 772ER in First. Having arrived from LAX 2 hours prior I was absolutely exhausted and was hoping to get some sleep on this leg. Boarding was smooth and the flight took off on time once the aircraft had reached cruising altitude and the seat belt sign was turned off I made my way to the galley and requested one of the two FA's (both were busy discussing their personal problems rather then attending to passengers) to turn down my bed I received a shocking impertinent response from her: ""So you want me to push a button for you"". Disgruntled and furious I prepared the bed myself and slept for the remainder of the flight. Around an hour before landing I was poked and woken up by the same rude flight attendant. At that point I expressed my frustration and told her she was not fit for purpose and shouldn't be working customer service orientated role. American Airlines has a good product in First (for a North American airline) I managed to sleep comfortably; however their poorly trained rude staff make it an unpleasant experience. Upon completing my flight I cancelled my return with AA and subsequently purchased a new flight with TAM which has a far superior product and customer service it's a shame they're suspending their first class on all routes from early next year.",0
"Terrible! Delayed, delayed, then cancelled. Couldn't reschedule for three days, no reimbursement for lodging, and rude service. That's what you get for flying with the lowest bidder.",0
FRA to JFK and back. I am a frequent traveller and have been on more than 25 airlines so far. But Singapore airlines always exceeds my expectations! They serve food in economy that could easily be served in business classes of other carriers. The entertainment system is just great and the legroom is good. The great attitude of the friendly crews gives you the feeling that you are welcome onboard and that it is a pleasure for them to make you feel comfortable. This was my second time on Singapore Airlines and definitely not the last one!,1
HKG-DPS found promo tickets business class seats are same price as Cathay Pacific economy. Travelled with them for the first time. Boeing 737-800 from HKG to KL is cramped for Biz class (similar to other airline's Premium Economy) service and food was good. The Malaysian Satay on the plane is great. Boeing 777-200 from KL to DPS was okay for a 3 hours flight much more roomy than the 737. Lounge in KL is sub-par to other 5-Star airlines. Generally a good flight but don't feel they are a 5-star airline.,1
Check in at Kansai A/P (Japan) is dysfunctional. I had bought round trip tickets state side for travel from SFO to Kansai due to personal circumstances I ended up buying the trip in 2 segments (for the same day). The first from SFO to Honolulu with a connecting Hawaiian flight to Kansai with similar routing on the return. I was assured I would be able to route my baggage through from SFO to Kansai and visa versa (i.e. without having to pickup and recheck in Honolulu). The agents at SFO were able to do this but the Japanese agent at Kansai insisted that Hawaiian required all baggage picked up at Honolulu with passenger responsibility to recheck bags for continuation flight to SFO. Of course this created undue/unnecessary passenger burden! Bottom line Hawaiian needs to improve training of the Japanese agents they hire for check in at Kansai. I will never take Hawaiian for travel outside the states again!,0
Round Trip OSL-BKK-GOT via HEL and HKK. Finnair New Airbus must have the worst economy seats ever fitted in an airplane impossible to sit right. The food served in economy was inedible both to and from Bangkok breakfast was served on Cathay flight from Hong Kong to Bangkok. In order to select a normal seat in economy Finnair charges ??6 it is not fair with a non budget airline they only serve one alcoholic beverage with the first meal. I was offered beer or wine with my breakfast at 10 o'clock in the morning leaving Bangkok. Staff are friendly and service minded. Finnair has turned from a really good airline to a high priced budget carrier.,0
On 21st August this year my wife and I were to fly United from Heathrow to Chicago and booked in early July. As soon as online check in opened I found that only five seats were left which meant that we were to be separated during the flight. How were all the rest allocated before the 24hr opening time? The night before we were due to fly out I received a text message to say that the flight was cancelled. Whilst on route to LHR a text arrived telling us to check in as normal. At the United desk we were told that we would be bussed to a hotel for the night. The best compensation they could offer was Economy Plus instead of our Economy seats. On the flight out the food was appalling. Drinks were served from jugs carried down the gangways in a very unprofessional style by very unprofessional stewardesses. After arrival at Chicago we thought our problems were over. Whilst in Washington we went to Dulles Airport to see a United Supervisor to ensure that we could sit together on the return flight on 11th September. The system would not allow her to print boarding cards with seat allocations more than 24hrs before departure but she printed some boarding cards and wrote the seat numbers on the cards. For the return journey we arrived in good time at Chicago checked in and boarded the aircraft on time to find that we had been given Economy Plus seats. Start up time came and went and then an announcement was made that an electrical fault existed. We waited eventually after a delay of approx. 1.5 hours we were off back to Blighty. The flight through the night was unpleasant due to the aircraft being very cold which made sleeping almost impossible. Altogether not a very good experience.,0
"I flew Etihad Airways flight 601 from Johannesburg to Abu Dhabi on 30 July 2014. The cabin crew on this flight was exceptional. They turned up the cabin temperature when asked and they were very friendly. The seats were the most comfortable I've sat in in economy class however this plane dud not have power points as expected. Departure was more than an hour later than expected. The connecting from Abu Dhabi to Rome was on flight 83: departure was late and complimentary grooming kits were not provided. It was on this flight that I realized that Etihad does not pay any attention to detail. The return leg of our trip was on flight 84 from Rome to Abu Dhabi on 9 August 2014. Departure was more than an hour late. The cabin crew was as cold as the cabin pressure which was freezing despite numerous requests from ""guests"" to turn up the temperature. This is unforgivable. I have never been so cold on a flight. We connected in Abu Dhabi to Johannesburg on flight 602. This flight had power points but was also more than an hour late. 45 minutes due to the airline and 30 minutes due to a customer. The cabin crew on this flight were helpful and efficient.",0
EDI-DUB. Utterly painful booking process on their web site which is not exactly user friendly. Flight experience was much better. Paid extra for seat at front of the aircraft and travelling with hand baggage only. Flight left on time but was late getting in as we had to do a go-around due to an aircraft in front of us in the landing queue being too slow.,1
I flew from Rome (FCO) to Stockholm to Oakland (OAK) on 21 Nov 2014. I was amazed at the price $493 one way including 1 checked bag 1 meal and 2 seat assignments. The next least expensive one way fare was another $450 and one extra stop! Do your homework read the Norwegian.com website to know their policies especially when it comes to checked baggage (20 kilos) and carry on (1 carry-on and 1 small personal bag). I decided to purchase my meal from Norwegian and I'm glad I did. In Stockholm you must clear customs and enter into a gate area specially for flights that are U.S. bound. One inside there is another processing before actually boarding. I thought two hours would be plenty to grab a beer and do a little shopping but after two lengthy line's it wasn't. Once you cross over to the international side there are no places to eat or drink! The first meal was surprisingly tasty I had a choice of Chicken or beef I chose the chicken. It came with two hot sides and a dessert. One drink was included I chose wine and a glass of water. Just before landing we were offered a sandwich and one cold side with coffee tea or water. The movies were all included in the price of the ticket. Do your homework and find out which seats have extra legroom on a 10 hour flight this will make a difference! I was in a bulkhead aisle row 7 the only problem with this seat were careless passengers passing into the galley and stepping on my feet. The seat was comfortable enough definitely bring your own pillow and blanket or just purchase one from Norwegian for $20. I thought the price of drinks spirits beer and snacks was expensive but I did like the option of ordering through my TV screen and having it delivered. I also liked the inflight map showing our route. I would definitely fly with Norwegian again.,1
Lhasa-Kathmandu. May 10 2014. Inexplicably instead of flying directly from Lhasa to Kathmandu which would be a diagonal flight path with Mount Everest to the left of the plane we flew due south then due west and so I saw Everest from my window seat on the right of the plane. I had asked to change my seat to the left window but was told that this was not possible so I was glad that I got to see Everest after all! Otherwise an OK flight. Nothing remarkably good or bad.,1
"LAX-DFW-ATL AA2410 1 Sep 14. S80 ancient aircraft. Very uncomfortable seats. Almost one-hour delay in DFW because of ""broken-seat"" paperwork. Delay in landing at ATL because we lost our gate. Slow baggage handling. Staying away from AA for a year or so.",0
Round-trip from Toronto to New York City on June 28/13 returning July 1/2013. WJ 1216 on June 28 and WJ 1217 on July 1st. We experienced flight delays on both our arrival and departure. This had nothing to do with WestJet as the delay was initiated by the airport. The flight crew made every effort to make the delay as comfortable as possible. Given food vouchers without even requesting it. Flight crew had been working over 12 hours and were still friendly and cheerful. Despite the 6.5 hour delay for a 1.5 hour flight it was still an overall pleasant experience.,1
Took various international and domestic flights with Avianca in February and was mostly very impressed. Good IFE fairly good food and quite helpful cabin crew (though not entirely smiley). Even had IFE on jet-based domestic flights so was able to keep entertained with Solitaire! Seating very comfortable on domestic legs but tight on international flights. Competing with Iberia probably keeps standards low on flights out of Madrid. Most flights on time though on two of the domestic flights one of our group's luggage went missing (though was sent on soon after). Am not convinced we will be able to check in online for our Cartegena to Bogota to Madrid flights but we will see and I will review those legs separately.,1
"Cathay's cabins on regional flights were in need of a re-do and a clean up. Cathay has rolled out a new ""regional business class"" seat that has partially addressed the upgrade but has totally ignored passenger comfort in the seat. First the seat is hard. On a short sector Manila/Hong Kong I found the seat uncomfortably hard and actually found my back aching. How can they have padded the seat so sparsely? Secondly the seat does offer some recline and an opportunity to snooze although not quite enough especially if one is tall. I'm short 5'8"" and my feet were bumping the apparatus in front of me that housed the next seats. Truly 2"" more of leg room would have been very good and one wonders why Cathay made the pitch so tight. Thirdly the seat has no foot rest - a true failing. How did this happen? In all Cathay's service is good and attentive but the seat in the new regional business class needs a respectable amount of padding 2"" more pitch and a place to rest one's feet when reclined!",1
Auckland-Guangzhou-Heathrow-Dublin and returned Paris-Guangzhou-Auckland. This was our second return flight with China Southern as we had enjoyed our previous experience two years before and the price was again very competitive. This time we were in a 787 Dreamliner for three legs. This is a wonderful plane with better pressure and more fresh air. There were many large screens in the cabin showing where we were flying over (Russia and China on the second leg) where previously this was not shown. We had individual screens for our entertainment. Instead of just two adult films in English there were numerous recent box office films and TV shows. Gone were the strange Chinese isometric exercises before landing. The hostesses were professional and polite but still with little understanding of English or non Asian cuisine. Half the menu is European food. For our 18 hour wait on our return at Guangzhou airport we were again put in the Pullman just across the road from the airport at their expense. Altogether my husband and I had an excellent return trip.,1
With seat allocation a good airline just got better. London Gatwick to Geneva with a Swiss crew who were charming and helpful and efficient. Boarding well organised and unstressful. Return on a very busy Airbus 320 and a bit less calm. People claiming not to know they had allocated seats had to be shunted around the cabin but we still got away on time. Great short haul product at a good price. What's not to like?,1
"MXP-MUC-MXP, outbound flight was early in the morning and departed on time from Milan. Return from Munich arrived 25 minutes prior our scheduled arrival time in Milan. On both flight crew members were polite and kind, airplane was cleed and new seat were very comfortable. I didn't use their inflight food service and I neither bought anything from the onboard shopping.",1
"I checked into the airport 5am on the 11th June. I'm a wheelchair passenger. I was told someone would be with me shortly. I sat for almost an hour waiting. Finally a lady told me they were short staffed so I would have to wait so I waited. My flight left for New York at 6.15, I barely made my flight and I was the last one on the plane. My flight on the other hand was ok. Would fly with Frontier Airline as long as I'm not in a wheelchair.",0
"I travel with them several times a year. I fly between England and Germany. This year I have travelled with them 4 times. After arriving at Bremen airport today my partner and I entered the queue to hand over her luggage. We had paid an additional 30 EUR the night before in order for her to take one piece of 15kg luggage as it is not included in the Ryanair booking price. My partner was flying to Stansted which is about 40 Miles north of London. After 5 minutes of standing in the queue the Ryanair person working at the desk disappeared and was talking to her friend at the hand luggage and boarding card control desk. I went over and asked her why she was not manning the desk any more and she said ""because I only take luggage 40 minutes before take-off"". When I said ""but we were waiting there and you closed the desk without even telling us"" she then lost her patience and got really rude. Subsequently we paid the 60 euros. They call themselves a ""no-frills airline"" but in effect they are indeed an uncaring ""no-service airline"". I would give them one star out of 10 for their airport staff. I will not be flying with them again.",0
ATH-CAI-KUL return Economy Class. We arrived CAI at 16.30 impressed with the new T3 nice clean and organized. We had connection flight to KUL in the night at 01.15. Due to wait of 8 hours for the next flight to KUL Egyptair staff welcomed us and offered us to stay free in a 5 star hotel (incl transfer + buffet dinner). All flights were ok cabin crew food and seats okay. In general for what we paid we had an excellent service.,1
9th March from Dubai to London at 16.30. Flight EK 005/QF 8005. Cabin crew were brilliant all done with a smile and they were very busy. Would definitely travel with Emirates again.,1
My sister-in-law flew back to Plattsburgh from Punta Gorda on Allegiant after a week-long visit. The first thing she said when she called after arriving in Plattsburgh was that the airplane was filthy. There were crumbs on her seat and the bathroom smelt awful and was dirty. A totally terrible experience especially after paying over $400 for her ticket and an additional $20 for a carryon that she was told was too big for the overhead. Never a problem on other airlines. They also had the nerve to charge her $5.00 for printing her boarding pass at the airport.,0
Caught EK408 from KL back to Melbourne on 21 March. From the lounge to the arrival the staff were fantastic. The inflight entertainment along with the meal starved should make Qantas wake up. Both beat Qantas and was served with staff who smiled and were a pleasure. Looking forward to my next flight in a week or so!,1
Adelaide to Cairns with a stop over in Brisbane. The flights were each 2 hours the seats were comfortable and the flight crew were very friendly.,1
BA 0027 ex London HR to Hong Kong which departed 30/9/14. Hong Kong to London Sector on 17/9/14. Inedible food lukewarm drinks cabin staff unsmiling and standard of personal grooming very low toilets were horrible- no loo paper or hand towels half way through 13 hour flight. It was a relief to get onto Cathay Pacific flight for next stage of my journey. How can two airlines be so different? British Airways is a disgrace.,0
Why have PAL started using old A340's on long haul flights to London? We flew Manila on September 29 2014 and frankly I was shocked when I got on board and saw no entertainment screens in the seats! Come on! This is long haul on a large scale! 15 hours. OK you gave out tablets to passengers that wanted them but to hold in your hand for hours on end is not good. Please get your act together PAL on this long laborious journey! Bring back the 777! Or we wont use you again.,1
LHR-JFK on my way to Rio and I found that the crew were very unpleasant and had a couldn't care attitude. The connecting flight to Rio was cancelled due to technical issues and a hotel was organised but we had a terrible time getting to he hotel as there was no one to guide or direct us. Very unpleasant experience both ways and the food was a joke too - serving a pizza for breakfast! It was take it or leave it as they had no other options. The crew looked so fed up to be there. I am doing the same journey again but this time definitely it will be a different airline.,0
FRA-TLV Boeing 737-800. EL AL use the Luxx Lounge at FRA. This is shared with Condor TunisAir US Airways Qatar and whoever wants to pay. Packed almost no food available and before passport control. A hassle and not worth it. Crew onboard nowhere near as nice as on the TLV-FRA flight. Not addressed by name this time. While the seat is not a lie-flat seat like LX or BA use to TLV it is more comfortable than the so-called business seat that LH and OS use. There could be more recline and more space between the rows but overall fine. Food and wines were again very good. Overall not as my previous flight with EL AL but better than the product LH offers on this route.,1
The best economy deals so far. Good food and crew service. Seats are a bit cramped and uncomfortable for long haul but for short haul like Mauritius to Johannesburg and Cape Town seats are comfortable and food standard is very high. Ground crew unfriendly at Mauritius airport and passengers seemed to come second. They talk amongst themselves rather than paying attention to passengers. Long waiting and queuing time is a norm. Too many unnecessary questions. Otherwise a very well run airline.,1
MAN-EWR. Incredibly slow check in (took over 1 hour) - about 4 open desks 1 of which was for Business. When this early in the morning you don't want to be waiting for more than an hour in a line! Onboard all was good meals average but the aircraft was quite clean tidy and with personal AVOD system.,1
SYD-PEN-SYD (via KUL) in Economy. SYD-KUL-SYD on new A330-300s. Check-in at SYD was fast and the agent was really friendly. Fast-track through immigration and security provided because of elite status. Priority boarding for status passengers honoured. Seated in bulkhead rows on both flights where legroom was plentiful. Onboard catering was reasonable and of a decent portion but nothing outstanding. Cabin crew were friendly and helpful with the exception of one particular female attendant on the SYD-KUL leg who was a bit abrupt with other passengers. IFE was AVOD with a reasonable selection of movies and TV shows. Seat itself was much more comfortable than I was expecting and recline was also quite generous which made it comfortable enough to get a decent amount of sleep on the overnight flight back home. Both flights on time. KUL-PEN-KUL was on very old B737-400s. These planes will thankfully be gone by the end of this year. Priority boarding on the domestic flights for status passengers honoured. Both flights slightly delayed. Peanuts and juice offered on these flights. Cabin crew for these flights were friendly helpful and enthusiastic. Overall I was very satisfied with my experience on all flights and for the price paid it was great value for money.,1
SIN-PEN-SIN economy. Flights on-time and service was very good. Food tasty for a 1 hour flight and better than carriers in Europe or US where you get nothing for flights this short. They hand out newspapers in different languages and blankets. T2 in SIN is good and efficient and online check-in easy to use. A very good regional carrier and puts other legacy carriers to shame.,1
I thought this airline was very good. 23kg for luggage so I took some golf clubs. Flight was cheap. The service onboard was limited but it didn't need to be overcomplicated on a 2 hour flight from London to Madrid. Flights were on time and got to the destination a bit early both ways. Luggage was on the conveyor at the other end as soon as I arrived.,1
"Travelled Club from MIA to LHR last week having made the outbound trip on a codeshare AA flight (which was excellent!) We paid an extra Â£170 to pre-book seats upstairs which was ridiculously expensive. It's been several years since I last tried BA Club on a transatlantic flight and I was frankly shocked at how bad the product has become. Compared to the Emirates business class I'd experienced from the far east just 6 weeks before BA are fast becoming the 'Lada' of the Airline business. The seats are no longer that comfortable with the window passenger having to step over the feet of the total stranger in the next row to get into the aisle. The entertainment? Really poor! But worst of all the food! I would have been disappointed to get rubbish like that served in Economy but when one has paid thousands of pounds for the privilege? The breakfast was a joke. A glass of orange juice accompanied by a few slices of fruit and melon and the offer of a tiny bacon roll! My wife had requested special vegetarian meals so when the bacon rolls came along the Cabin Crew first offered her one then said ""Oh sorry of course you're vegetarian!"" and that was it - no alternative! Never again BA!",0
I was supposed to fly out of Adelaide on 27 April 2011 to Melbourne and was told as I checked in (with four other family members) that the flight was cancelled and they booked us on a flight for 29 April 2011 to Melbourne at 7.30 am . After arriving to check in and waiting 4 hours they told us the flight was cancelled 'again'. Offering me a refund in 48 hours I had to find another carrier to fly home with. Cancelling a flight once was very disappointing but twice just reflects that these people should not run an airline. Reason for the cancellation was not given apart from operational reasons. Hopefully CASA shuts them down.,0
My husband and I flew from Charlotte NC to Chicago Il on June 7 2013. On this particular day there were thunder storms and high winds all up and down the east coast. While we were waiting one flight had to return to the airport because of the weather and another was cancelled. Our flight was a bit late and had to circle the airport for a while waiting to land - all due to the weather. Though our flight was a little late we made up time in flight and landed almost the time we were supposed to land. Though the plane was small it was comfortable. Our carry on baggage was put under the plane just before boarding and collected again as we left. Overall it was a pleasant experience. We were pleased.,1
We flew from LAX to Dublin Ireland. I will never fly United again. The plane looked old it was also dirty. The drink service took forever! I realized it was because when you order a soda they don't give you a cup of ice and the can anymore. No. They now open a can a pour some into the cup for you and then use the same can for the next passenger. I've never had an airline do this. Very cheap. The worst part was the food. I am a vegetarian. When I booked the flight and went online to request a vegetarian option the only option I saw was Indian food. I highly dislike Indian food so I thought this was odd. I called customer service to inquire about other vegetarian options. They have no satisfactory options for vegetarians. I told her I would stick with the regular meal instead my plan was to eat the sides. When the meal service came around they brought me the Indian vegan plate! I told them that I did not request this and asked for a regular meal. They said they did not have enough and maybe once they served everyone if there was an extra I could have it. I didn't eat on the way to Ireland. On the way back I had to make sure to bring food for me to eat on the plane. Both flights to and from were delayed by 2+ hours.,0
PER-KUL. A330-300. Flight left a little late - seemed a little unorganised. In flight entertainment non existent (unless you rent a PSP/Samsung tab with pre-loaded films/games etc for - A$15) but that aside the onboard product was very good. Impressive range of meals to chose from with snacks and drinks at affordable prices - they were half the price than the airport. New and clean cabin. The 3x3x3 seat layout is a little narrow but it's a low cost carrier after all.,1
Check in and Fast Track were both very efficient as were the cabin crews on both legs. Minor gripes are the 'Complimentary Toiletries' whose content appeared designed for young children rather than Business Class passengers and a very mediocre lounge at Bangkok. Main Meal on the return leg was rather bland but for the overall price paid was more than acceptable.,1
MEL-HKG-YYZ return in economy. It was okay let's face it economy is never going to be fantastic but for economy it was just fine and I would do it again. As we were going to Canada we were allowed 23kg x 2 which is great. I considered upgrading to Premium Economy but it would have been an EXTRA $4000 for the two of us just too much. The flight to and from HKG from Mel was fine. Seat a little hard but we found sitting on their blanket in its bag helped there. The food was okay. The FA's were lovely very friendly. Entertainment very good also. Flight to Toronto was full. We paid extra for exit row seats. Was very cold against the door. I had wrapped just about everything I could around my legs it was really freezing there but still not a bad seat in that you could just walk straight out of it no climbing over anyone so if you go for that seat bring warm items for your legs. Going to YYZ was better than returning. Returning the staff seemed to disappear. They were not very organised at YYZ coming back either the line ups were all messed up and wheelchairs couldn't get through. They called the far rows first before business and it was just a big crazy mess of confused people. We were late leaving HKG for MEL due to late passengers but not surprising as there was a gate change. Mostly though the flights were on time our luggage arrived safely the entertainment was good and thank goodness there were no shell seats as what we experienced back in March. After travelling to Canada before via LA this is a far better option even if longer. Stopping over in HKG is ideal and the airport there is very efficient.,1
YVR?MNL-YVR (Aug 26 Sep 10). The service was great. The flight attendants were always available to assist passengers and several times they go around to give water and snacks. They serve dinner and breakfast. The food is tasty and comparable with other Asian airlines. The B777-300 aircraft is spotless the legroom is ample the seat will recline and it has personal entertainment system with good selections of movies games and music. Overall PAL did a good job and I will fly with them again.,1
Washington-BRU on Nov 21st. Newly equipped Airbus for this flight. Perfectly on time. I am a frequent flyer of Brussels in Europe. The worse disappointment on this airbus is the poor comfort of the economy cabin. Compared to Lufthansa you seem to sit on a wooden bench! The video equipment is latest generation though the least as you can't manage to sleep!,0
Ljubljana to Brussels with CRJ900. Boarding on time. The aircraft looked quite new and very clean. Meal served was above my expectations. Cabin crew were very nice. The only thing that was bad was the seating arrangement. I sat in 13th or 14th row and that row didn't have any windows! Otherwise flight was ok.,1
Flew last month with their leased b737-800 KUL-KCH. Cabin well kept. Not great like their new sky interior. Seat comfortable on this route. Cabin crew service was excellent. Friendly full of smiles helpful and professional.,1
"PDX-ATL round trip. Very uncomfortable seats poor food offered flight attendants acted like they were doing passengers a favor. Had to wait forever to use to toilet. Since Continental merged with United they have sunk to an all time low. In the past they allowed upgrades for a reasonable fee - not anymore! They let premium seats go empty even when the plane was on its last segment and airborne the flight attendants would not let anyone sit in an area with more leg room. They said it was ""reserved"". I simply refused to upgrade to first class for $619 and they had empty seats there also. In the past before they merged with United I could upgrade for around $100 if seats were available. I simply don't understand the cost/benefit ratio of letting seats go empty instead of making them affordable or allowing someone to use coach class seats with more leg room once the aircraft is in flight. My ticket wasn't cheap to start with and the service I got was terrible from start to finish. This merger was not for the better!",0
Recently travelled to India on an Air Mauritius flight back and fro on MK748 and MK 749 respectively. However I am very disappointed by the services offered on board. I travelled together with my spouse and infant of less than 2 years old. On departure on 27th December we requested a baby cot (ticket booked on 11th November 2013 - more than a month before) and on check-in same was requested again and approval obtained. However to our disappointment we did not get one on board. The reason given was that the baby was too big for the cot and the weight was too heavy. The infant weighs: 10.3 kg and his height is 73 centimetres. The crew did not even bother to check if the infant fits the cot or not but bluntly refused. We had to hold a crying baby whole night which not only disturbed us but we had an earful from other passengers. On our return (10th Jan 2014) same scenario. Despite request no infant cot and even worse we did not have a front seat to handle a baby. Instead we were put on a seat with other seats in front which was really uncomfortable. I and my spouse had to carry the infant whole night. There was another couple who benefited from a cot and we tried it on my infant and he fits perfectly well. In fact we had more rooms than expected. When I told the cabin crew they told me that you are not in a front seat and hence cannot give you one now. (The irony is that a cot was requested and approved at Check-in in Mumbai). We did not even get an infant meal on both trips. The service we got on the flight was very disappointing and frustrating. I am frequent traveller on Air Mauritius and as from now I will rather use other carriers for my overseas trip be it personal or business related. A very disappointed customer.,0
We flew from Heathrow to Dubai on an Airbus 380 early in December 2013 on this trip they ran out of food choices and I was told that I could not get the chicken that I had asked for. The flight crew were harassed and totally disorganized. When we few back in March 2014 exactly the same thing happened - sorry we have run out of the choice you asked for on the menu. Also my headphones were not working after having had the light on for about two hours I eventually got up and went to the crew to ask for another one. Emirates prides itself on good service and this was not the case on the Airbus. We flew from Dubai to Johannesburg and back on a 777 and I cannot fault the service on these planes.,0
My sisters and I went to Minneapolis. We left Idaho Falls flight 446 and 120 on July 25 2014. Flights went smoothly and staff were nice. July 29 2014 on our return flights 115 and 447. We arrived at the Frontier counter to check in and were told a tornado hit Denver and all seats were taken and no seats available until Aug 3 2014 so we could get a refund that night. In a panic we checked other airlines to Idaho Falls we could get another flight the next morning Delta or United. We asked the Frontier counter to help us book a flight they said they could not help us either a refund or travel Aug 3. We were about to ask for our refund when my brother in law suggested we try again to get to Denver options were better there to get to Idaho Falls and cheaper. The ladies at the counter said they could not help us we asked if their were seats available on flight 115 finally they said yes there were seats available but we would miss the flight to Idaho Falls. We told them we would take our chances since the flight going to Denver was delayed 1 hour maybe the flight to Idaho Falls would also be delayed they would not assign us seats to Idaho Falls just to Denver only check our baggage to Denver which we opted to carry on. We barely arrived at the gate for flight 115 after 2 hours of fighting with staff at the check in counter as they were boarding. Staff on the flight were very nice and apologetic. Flight 447 was delayed due to weather as we expected and had to wait for seating assignments just as they were boarding. Boarded the plane and again their were a few empty seats. Arrived in Idaho Falls only 30 minutes later than the scheduled arrival time! Had we not insisted that staff get us on flight 115 we would still be in Minnesota.,0
HKG-YVR. Each time I take Air Canada between Vancouver and some Asian destination I become increasingly frustrated with half of the staff's attitudes. It seems to me that some of these flight attendants tend to get easily frustrated towards Asian passengers. One flight attendant was lecturing me what I should and should not place in the overhead compartment (I really wish I just ignored her). Another major issue I have with the new seat design is the placement of the earphone plug which is located in front of us. It's extremely inconvenient to unplug it in and out all the time when a passenger next to you has to get up. Plus this is also one of the least comfortable economy seats I have sat on.,0
"Asiana Airlines business class from Seoul to Phuket on an ageing 767-300 was not up to par. Reasonably good cabin crew service but lousy meal from Asiana's Seoul hub. Angled ""lie flat"" seat was terribly uncomfortable for six hour flight. Seat seemed small and had poor recline - making sleep virtually impossible. Entertainment options were satisfactory.",1
Paid full fare for a non reclining seat with reduced leg room on an overnight 11.5 hour flight. Finnair advised they prioritise passenger numbers over passenger comfort! Also advised there is a 20 euro charge to pre-book a seat to make sure you can recline (60 euros for extra leg room). Food I believe was very average but don't really know as I couldn't really eat when the passenger in front reclined their seats into my face. Inflight entertainment was not on demand and very limited and somewhat dated but as screen was at the end of my nose it was impossible to watch. Anyway. My advice is don't risk flying with Finnair.,0
LGW-RIX-LGW. Outbound leg was 2 hrs delayed the reason was not explained. Cabin attendants were obviously tired and unfriendly they ignored me when I wanted to buy a snack!,1
First time with Air New Zealand on a short hop from Wellington to Auckland. Old B733 but well maintained and with comfortable seating. Loved the safety video. Smart looking crew very efficiently managed to serve a drink (coffee tea water) and a snack during this short domestic flight. Ground staff made me check-in my carry-on as it was 1 kg over the weight limit. Wish they would enforce this with all travellers as other passengers brought large pieces of luggage on board. Flight about double the price than Jetstar on same route and as a QF Platinum will give my business to Jetstar in the future. This one time NZ booking was done due to flight times as I needed to catch an international flight from Auckland.,1
We travelled for the first time with Kenyan Airways and found staff very friendly and helpful. The food on board was adequate and hot. The seats were not very comfortable seat pitch poor and not much room. The return trip was on a newer aircraft I think and the onboard entertainment system worked fine.,1
We flew BKK-DXB-LGW-DXB-BKK on the flights to/from BKK it was on a 380 to/from LGW a 777. The 380 seating is very comfortable with full recline the 777 is not full recline so not as comfortable. Also on the 777 we were in the front row so had the TV screen on the aisle seat in a standalone stand which reduces the access to the window seat. All flights were on time for arrival even when departure was delayed for up to 25 mins which with relatively short transit times at DXB (,1
SIN-POM-SIN on B767s. Friendly professional and efficient service from the crew made the flights bearable. Flights were largely on time. Exit row 10 had unbelievable leg room but it also meant other passengers climbed over us to get to the toilets in the other aisle. Food was ok. Touch-screen entertainment screens were great but bring your own headphones. Entertainment selection was limited.,1
"Over the last 2 weeks in Vietnam we have had 5 domestic flights with Jetstar and all of them have been delayed by 3-5 hours. Jetstar don't send updates the staff couldn't care less and as a result you are left spending hours in the uncomfortable departure lounge that has very limited food options and not enough seats. We have wasted 2 days of our precious holiday because of this airlines incompetence. This is particularly frustrating when you have young kids. One of our flights was delayed from the reasonable departure time of 4pm to 8.55pm! Their nickname in Vietnam is ""Delay Star"". Wish we had booked Vietnam Airlines instead. Do yourself a favour even if Jetstar is cheaper don't use them. You will be very disappointed. Do not book connecting flights as you will not make the connection.",0
Review based on 1 RT economy flight from Seattle to Hangzhou via Beijing. I would rate them a solid 4 out of 5 on pretty much everything. Our connecting flight from Beijing to Hangzhou was cancelled 2 days before flight. They contacted us by phone and gave us option of staying overnight in Beijing at their expense and taking first flight in morning which we accepted. All that went off without a hitch. On arriving in Beijing on our way back to Seattle we were met at the gate by a Hainan employee who walked us through baggage claim customs and security all the way to the gate for our Seattle flight which was in another terminal. This was a tremendous help. Inflight service food etc was neither remarkably good or bad. They were efficient and friendly but don't have the noticeable class or polish of a top of the line carrier. Also the English language skills of their reservation staff is just barely adequate. I had to contact them by phone several times prior to the flight to confirm our flight change and that proved fairly stressful though everything worked out in the end. Both international flights appeared to be new or nearly new aircraft. Connecting flights between Beijing and Hangzhou were noticeably older but clean and well maintained. Overall I'd say they are quite acceptable for a budget airline though a notch below the top of the lines such as Singapore airlines. Would not hesitate to fly with them again.,1
Ryanair does not allow you to get boarding passes for the return flights straightforwardly at the same time as for the outward flight although within the 30 day period. This resulted in a Â£70 charge for each of our return flights. A lot of people seem to have been caught out by this see other reviews. This seems to be a new practice and I could not recommend Ryanair to anyone in future since there is a real risk that their holiday will be ruined as a result of this disgusting sharp practice. I could not help noticing that the return fight was not full and would not be surprised if fights are even emptier in future.,0
POS-TAB. Very quick shuttle flight between Trinidad and Tobago. Check in immediate in POS and passed through into separate 'domestic' departure area for the shuttle. Went through to find absolutely nothing other than seats so were allowed back through to get drinks etc. Boarded on time polite and professional crew. Brand new turboprop with comfy leather seats and very generous legroom. Such a short hop so no drinks etc. Bags for the 20 or so passengers did seems to take an age to come from the aircraft but other than that excellent and cheap.,1
EWR-Beijing via Taipei Shanghai Hongqiao to Taipei Shongsheng and Taipei Tayouan to EWR business class. Generally a very nice trip with attentive service good food and on excellent on board entertainment. The new lounge in Taoyuan airport Terminal 2 with nice shower and food service. The transit in Taipei to Beijing is very smooth. The flight attendants polite and attentive on-demand meals were nice. The weakest link is the angled flat bed. Not comfy for a tall person - it's definitely not the same as real flat beds that most airlines now have. Cabin clean and modern. Probably use again if they can introduce new flat bed.,1
"LGW-BGI-LGW Club World R/T. Old careworn B777-200. Airplane was not clean both sectors. Food outbound from Gatwick was almost inedible and unbelievably they also ran out of choices. Inbound airplane toilets reeked. At least food on return was slightly improved. Cabin Crew both sectors were simply going through the motions and were rushed / robotic. The Club World seats are narrow and uncomfortable. The inflight entertainment system was a bad joke. Screens poor and tiny selection of movies. BA's so called Business Class experience is woefully outdated and an extremely poor product when compared to other international carriers. I am amazed that British Airways standards are so low and they get away with it. This is mere A to B transport. What is missing from their Business Class is ""class"".",0
CDG-AMM-BKK return in economy. CDG-AMM Airbus A320 not clean fixed seat backs just like low cost airlines! VOD simple but correct. AMM-BKK like BKK-AMM A330-200 well maintained and cleaned with good VOD programs. Cabin crews not concerned by service: attendants deliver standard care to passengers. Very few smiles and rather slow response. BKK-AMM the two rear toilets were note in use. The only good point in all sectors is food: tasty natural and served in large portions while drink selection is more than correct. AMM airport is not too busy. RJ delivers an average product with average aircraft and lower than average cabin crews but higher than average food.,0
LHR-NYC-LHR on 747's. Planes were old and surprisingly dirty. Staff nice and chatty trying to make you feel welcome and providing a good service. Cabin and IFE old and worn out. I would recommend VS only if you get your ticket for a good price otherwise the other European carriers are a better alternative.,0
"Return flight from Manchester both flights on a Boeing 757. Both flights were full. The legroom was adequate. The crew were professional, served pre ordered hot meals first, then a trolley offering sandwiches, drinks and snacks. Food is for sale. Not cheap but not too expensive either. One return much the same. Only negative, on landing back In Manchester it took an hour and a half for luggage to come out on to the luggage belt. Overall I found them for price paid, good value.",1
In July 2013 my husband and flew to Sri Lanka from Melbourne for a 3 week holiday. The flight was good from Melbourne to Malaysia short turn around then on to Colombo. The return was hoped to go as smoothly but not to be. I have two issues with the airline both about treatment to passengers. Firstly flying from Colombo to Malaysia we were subjected to extremely loud promotional material about the airline for over 30 minutes. It left us with fingers in our ears and quite annoyed as it was very early morning. Many people were clearly discomforted by it and a request by another passenger to turn it down was ignored. That alone would lead me to not fly again. I made the mistake of ordering a vegetarian meal on the flight over and had the most bland and unimaginative food possible. My husband enjoyed his food but noted it was considerably poorer quality on the flight back to Australia. I will avoid this airline from now on and next flight was booked with Singapore Airlines.,0
Manchester - Cancun (1st December). Flight delayed an hour but we had been informed of this by TC about 2 months previously that this would be the case so this was no problem. We pre booked seats both outbound and inbound and after reading other people's reviews about these pre paid seats not being kept I was worrying although I had no reason to as everything was fine. The plane an Airbus A330 was in good condition the seats were comfortable with plenty of leg room the cabin crew were friendly the entertainment was good and helped pass the time and the food was decent quality. Flight back was on time we had very good tail wind which knocked off a good 1-1.5 hrs off the flight. Food was good again as was the entertainment. The cabin crew were perhaps not as attentive coming back but this was only a minor snag and it didn't ruin our flight by any means. After reading so many bad reviews I had feared the worst but we had two very pleasant flights with them and would fly again.,1
I have flown several times this year on the Bacolod - Manila route most recently in the last week of May. Delays are dreadful as they seem to be on other PAL Express routes. Some of the delays are due to congestion at Manila Airport but most are not. What makes a frustrating situation worse is the complete inability to keep passengers (and those waiting to collect them) informed. Check the airport information screens and they will likely say the departure time was two hours ago; check the internet and there is no indication of any delay. Absolute rubbish. Once the plane takes off then the seating and service are fine for a budget airline.,0
"BT642 on June 20th. BT641 on June 28th. ZRH-RIX-ZRH. Although AirBaltic has a nice homepage its complicated to operate and ""forgets"" settings that you have made (e.g. I selected check-in bags for both the outbound and inbound flights I had to enter this several times and in the end this was only picked up for the outbound flight so I had to pay extra for the inbound flight at the airport). Check-in at the airport costs extra but online check-in and mobile boarding passes do work. No food & beverages not even water. The planes are really old.",0
Vegas from Toronto. When I called them to book specific seats I was on hold for over 45 mins. When I spoke to the travel site about this they said this is quite normal. We couldn't print boarding passes from their site. When called Rouge it was another 1 hour on hold. She said there seemed to be a problem with the site and to just print them out at the airport. We paid extra ($160 for 2 people/round trip) to seated by the emergency seats for the extra leg room. There seemed to be a problem with their heating because it was freezing the whole time. The food was bland and cold within seconds of receiving it. The flight attendants took forever to carry out requests.,0
Flew Manchester - Preveza 2 June and return 9 June. Charter Flight (MON 5642 and 5643) but incredibly expensive as not many flights to this airport that serves mainly Parga and Lefkada in Greece. By the time you add on luggage fee sitting together fee meal fee (if wanted) and upgrade to more legroom fee (if wanted) it is prohibitively expensive - thank heavens Olympic are adding two flights from the UK soon so should bring prices down. Relatively clean and tidy A300 with cheerful FA's. Be warned - the 3-3-3 seating plan meant that seats were very narrow. On the plus side the flights were on time despite only a 2 hour check in window at Preveza - a very rural Greek airport! A far cry from a scheduled Monarch flight to Gibraltar a few years ago that was a real delight.,0
Our second experience flying with Cathay Pacific. Flew Manchester to Narita via Hong Kong and return in Business (January 2015). The service food and seat were all excellent on outbound and inbound legs on the 777-300 apart from the Hong Kong to Narita leg which was a regional configuration. I found the shell seat to be a little uncomfortable as I am 5ft 3in and could not get the leg rest to a comfortable angle with my legs and feet left dangling. Cathay uses a third party lounge at Manchester Terminal 2 which was small but adequate for a light breakfast. A member of Cathay ground staff escorted us all from the lounge to the boarding gate and we were boarded before the other passengers. A short transfer at HKG but the Wing lounge was very crowded. The First Class lounge was being upgraded so First passengers were allocated half of the Wing business section. It was almost impossible to find a seat. The return leg we found the Cathay lounge at Narita quite disappointing so used the JAL lounge instead which had a better selection of food and more comfortable seating. Boarding was a shambles however as we were called to the gate early. The flight was not yet open for boarding and the gate area was not big enough to accommodate everyone. Although there was a separate First/Business boarding lane this was so clogged with Economy passengers the staff gave up and just let everyone through regardless. However once on board the service was excellent and luckily the 777-300 had the long haul flat-bed seats. Transit through HKG was swift and we decided to use the Bridge lounge which was not very crowded and had a very good selection of food and drinks. We had time for a shower and relax before the HKG-MAN flight at 01.00 am. Unfortunately when we got to the gate for boarding the plane had not been towed onto stand so we had to stand around for about 45 minutes before boarding started. Here though once started the boarding was much more organised and the First/Business passengers were boarded first with less of a scrum to get on board. The flight was very bumpy which meant we did not get as much sleep as we had hoped but we arrived on time even though we had departed late. Manchester airport immigration was empty at 6.20 am so we got through and collected our luggage in about 15 minutes. Apart from the chaotic boarding at Narita and the poor lounge we would certainly choose to fly CX again.,1
Star Class SYD-HNL-SYD 11/6/2012 return 21/06/2102. Check in easy crew fantastic. I'm 6ft 4in plenty of legroom better than Qantas 747 Premium Economy. Enjoyed Qantas club both in Sydney and Honolulu food was good.,1
CDG-VIE-CDG. Outbound got upgraded in Business. Airbus A321 - padding of the new seats is too thin decent legroom blocked middle seat. Got some newspapers but no welcome drink. After takeoff got a delicious hot meal: smoked salmon tasty veal burger with potatoes gratin strawberry mousse. Inbound in Economy - same seats as in Business. Very limited catering on this two-hour flight: quite small ham sandwich drinks. On both flights cabin crew polite but not overly friendly - however pilots were very informative. Senator lounge in VIE fairly small and overcrowded - but good drink selection and delicious Do&Co food offer.,1
My wife was booked Riyadh to Bangalore travelling alone and booked in business class. We arrived at the airport at 0100 hrs and completed check in. She was given a boarding pass which did not mention the number of the Gate from which to board. When I asked the man at the counter which gate we should go to he waved his hand dismissively and told me to go to immigration. When my wife went to immigration she was told the flight was cancelled and referred back to the airline. We came back and asked a Saudi Airlines employee; he told us the flight would leave at 1300 hrs. I asked him why this information was not communicated to us earlier as we had provided our mobile numbers at the time of booking. I also asked why this was not told to us when the boarding pass was issued. There was no satisfactory response to my questions. We reached our home at 3 am and returned to the airport at 11 am. There was no indication at the airport of when the flight would leave or indeed which from which gate passengers should depart. The staff of Saudi Airlines were of no help at all. The plane finally left at 2 pm. On board my wife found that her seat would not recline and she had sit upright for 5 hours. Though Saudi Airlines advertises vegetarian Indian food for flights to India there was no vegetarian meal available. Not only is the service deplorable but staff are brusque and unhelpful. We choose this carrier because it is the only one that has a direct flight from Riyadh to Bangalore. Perhaps we should start flying other carriers even if it means a transhipment because their staff may be more competent and helpful.,0
Paris to Hanoi 777-200. Business class flight. Very good service. Polite and attentive. Very good food. Plenty of it with drinks available on demand. Seats were not lay flat but very good recline and fully adjustable. Cabin was comfortable with lights down for much of flight for good sleep. Entertainment via Ipad provided but had good selection of movies and programs. Aircraft's were quite old and looked worn. Would recommend this company to others.,1
We flew from Miami to Barcelona to catch a cruise and came back to Miami from Venice two weeks later. A380-800 on the long haul and A320-200 on the short flights. My wife needed and received through Lufthansa special services wheelchair assistance. The Lufthansa staff was wonderful and took care of all of our needs promptly. The meals in economy were very good and water and juice were distributed 4 times during the long haul flights. The staff were very welcoming throughout the flights. We try to fly Lufthansa whenever possible.,1
I would certainly fly them again. The Service was good the seats were roomy and the food delicious. I also liked that the flight length from Perth to Doha and then to Manchester was great. It was 10.5 hrs from here to Doha then 6.30 hrs from Dhoa to Manchester. Keep up the good work.,1
FRA-SIN-FRA on A380 in economy. Flight was cheap left/arrived on time and meals were fine but those were the only real positives. Fortunate to snag a seat with no seat in front so endless legroom. All other seats in economy looked ridiculously cramped. Seat itself was extremely uncomfortable for the 12 hour flight and the constant prodding of the touch screen from the passenger behind is a little annoying. (Unfortunately this is the only way to operate the screen as the remote is basically useless) Entertainment system would have been ok but crashed 3 times. Am Lufthansa 'Senator' status which helped in being able to secure one of the best seats (53D) other than that absolutely no recognition of so called status on board unlike Air New Zealand where one feels welcome pampered and valued - even though it is not my 'home' airline. All in all pretty sad for such a proud airline.,0
Flew LGW-LPA on 15th April 2013. A great price Â£131 for 2 with bags and seat reservation. Flight delayed by an hour. Comfy seats TV entertainment no sound but cartoons which are easy to watch. Food prices OTT on the flight so buy before you fly. Waited a while for bags at LPA it was very quiet so cannot understand why it took so long. We have booked again with Norwegian.,1
LHR-CMB. Planes slightly dated and worn and seats could be more comfortable. Good selection of films on the inflight entertainment screens were viewable but the image quality not great (in my seat anyway). On the plus side food was really good and drinks were offered frequently.,1
The airline is fine as far as on time baggage goes through quickly staff are friendly and helpful. However the boarding procedure (no assigned seats) is just a way to charge people for a reasonable line placement. So when considering flying SW with a family that would like sitting together add from 15 to 40 dollars to the price of a ticket and purchase the upgrade. All and all a fine airline for those flying alone but not family friendly.,0
Paris to Newark. Roomy seats that recline allowing you to get a comfortable rest. Lots of space between rows. You can have up to 3 pieces of luggage up to 23 kg. However worn out seats and old noisy plane. Flight attendants weren't very attentive. There was no duty free on board. They give you an old handheld screen with a limited choice of films. The meal took a very long time with a 1 hour wait between dishes. Food was average. Do not book the aisle seat on the first row of Business seats as there is less leg room because of the emergency exit door.,0
Booked on Delta flight out of a local regional airport MLI to New Bern North Carolina via connection in Atlanta. Flight was scheduled to depart at 4.59pm. It was pushed back to 7.30 as the incoming flight out of Atlanta has mechanical problems and they were bringing in another plane. Flight delayed a second time to 8.39pm and cancelled. Both at the delay and cancellation the customers had to leave the secure area and go back out to the ticket counter. We were told the flight was cancelled because the crew timed out. All flights on Delta out of Chicago and United were booked. They have no reciprocating agreement with Southwest or U.S. Air and could not see their reservation. Delta told us to come back the next day at 4.50 for that flight. We finally via the internet were able to book a flight earlier the next day out of Chicago with U.S. Air for $400 more than the original ticket. We had purchased insurance through Alliance. Delta would only refund the ticket price and would not pay the difference. The people at the ticket counter were less than helpful they had given up and didn't care. I won't be flying Delta again not if I can help it at least. U.S air was on time and staff was very friendly.,0
"Flew from Gatwick to Puerto Plata (TOM096) on 3/8/2014 on the ""Dreamliner"" more like nightmare liner. Plane was dirty with water dripping onto my friend food disgusting was supposed to be some kind of chicken and pasta in a tomato sauce was so dry and hard I think we were all served food left over from the week before. Staff well all I will say is if you hate your job that much then do something else. Pilot unable to land first time lots of panicking going on but not one word from pilot or flight attendants to let us know what was going on (quick message after from the ""spare pilot"" (yes that was his words). Return flight (TOM097) on 17/8/2014 was a completely different experience clean plane friendly happy flight staff and edible food. Please be aware you are offered no tea or coffee refills so the only free drinks you get are the ones you get with your meal. we travelled economy class and the seating is more spacious than normal.",0
I flew from London Gatwick and was looking forward to my 1st time flying with Norwegian. The plane was comfortable and clean and I had pre ordered meals and was served not long after takeoff - not massively impressed with the meal but ok as far as plane food goes. It was a whole 8hrs before we were given anything else to eat and was very disappointed with my very small sandwich muffin and apple juice. There was no information of what other snacks were available as the order service on the TV screen was not working. I would recommend anyone flying with them to bring their own food.,0
MEL-KUL-BKK Return on AirAsiaX. The planes are relatively new they leave and arrive on time staff are efficient and friendly and ensure that safety standards are met. There could however be more variety in the hot meals offered. Most importantly the airlines provides value for money and offers very good promotional deals. The one problem however is the inability to provide transit services at KL's LCCT airport. You need to have at least three hours to make an Asian connection given the length of time it take to clear Malaysian immigration and to make your way back into the airport to check in for your onward connection. If transit facilities were offered the airline would be my number one choice for travel out of Australia.,1
PHL-ORD-XNA. With a little luck I experienced the new First Class on American Eagle on their CRJ aircraft. I say luck as there is no clue that there would be first class on the flights - seat selection map was as normal - all one class but I happened to pick in the first 3 rows and got a first class seat FA told me that there is no priority given to frequent fliers and I felt that is an oversight by AE to show off their product to their best customers. Seats will be sold as first class from July 1. Seats were very comfortable - in fact the most comfortable American Eagle flights I have had! One downside is the loss of the overhead on the single seat side (there are 3 rows of 1+2) and one of the remaining bins contained an oxygen canister. Maybe AE missed a chance to put some full size bins on the one side? Definitely a step in the right direction for AE and I will no longer avoid their CRJ aircraft (as I do the Embraer).,1
Return flight ZB 655 Malaga to Manchester 12/06/2013. Flight delayed owing to French strike approximately 2.5 hours on arrival at Manchester after a good flight waited 1.75 hours for baggage there was no explanation of the delay other passengers of different flights collected their baggage without problems as many as 6 flights arriving after our flight were cleared before we were able to collect our baggage. There was nobody about to who we could discuss the problem which seamed to be a lack of supervision resulting in a 4 hour total delay which cannot all be lay at the feet of Monarch but in the circumstances shows a lack of care for customer service.,0
We travelled to Cancun on 3rd January 2013. Flight took a couple of hours longer due to headwind which made an uncomfortable flight even more unpleasant. The seat I had pre-booked at extra cost would not fully recline so sleeping for part of the journey to recover from an early start was impossible. The inflight entertainment is limited you are encouraged to pay an extra Â£10 to be able to watch films at a time convenient to you. The inflight food is meagre. If you want water it is to be paid for. On long haul flights surely this should be free. Inflight staff spend most of their time selling food and drink and other payable options. After spending 8 hours on this flight we were then told that we would have to complete customs immigrations forms for Mexican customs but they didn't have any on board. Later we were told that someone would bring them out to the plane when we landed and given to us on debarkation. However they had run out/ We were then told we could get them in the customs hall. Arrived in the customs area to overcrowded chaos. They managed to locate some forms for us and we then had to try to complete them whilst we were walking in the queue. Another passenger in the queue told us they had the same trouble last year! I always considered Thomson to be a good company to book with. Not anymore.,0
We had 9 hour delay at Gatwick with only explanation as 'operational difficulties' The flight then went to Havana instead of our destination which was Holguin we then had to get internal flight. The food was worst we ever had on flight no films and the individual lights did not work so when cabin lights dimmed we couldn't even read. The toilets were not kept clean and ran out of soap and paper towels. If you have the choice please use another airline we certainly will never fly with them again.,0
JQ415 OOL-SYD Airbus A320. Great end to our holiday with Jetstar. We arrived at the airport early enough to get transferred from JQ417 (departed at 13.30) to JQ415 (departed at 12.20) free of charge. Leather seats were comfortable however we didn't get to choose seats free of charge when booking. The staff were pretty friendly and the food/beverages and entertainment was good.,1
I have flown from Paris CDG to Sofia with an Embraer 190. Nice staff serving excellent food. Nevertheless the legroom in the first business row is quite bad.,1
JFK-ZRH on A330. We arrived at ZRH airport 50 min ahead of time which was great. The food was not good unfortunately. The seats were okay and the entertainment system much better than A340. We had two ladies serving us during the flight. Both of them seemed to be having a bad day: no smiling at all and short unfriendly comments to guests. The staff were obviously very stressed which made me feel uncomfortable.,1
"I'm a first time user of Ryanair. I don't mind that the plane is crowded or amenities are non-existent. I expected that at the price but I have a big gripe with their fees. I didn't know that boarding passes could not be printed at the airport. It was pointed out to me by the staff that the fine print does say I needed to print my pass. Also I was sent a warning email which I didn't see since I was in the middle of my vacation. Then I find the ""fee"" is 70 euros each for my wife and I. This isn't a fee this is a punishment. I sent a complaint letter to Ryanair and the response was that this charge was correct according to their policy. Well it isn't a very satisfactory policy. I could have flown a normal airline for the total amount I paid Ryanair.",0
"19 April KWI-LHR BA157. LHR-EDI BA1454. 3 May EDI-LHR BA1459. LHR-KWI BA156. KWI-LHR-EDI-LHR-KWI: booked World Traveller Plus (Premium Economy) but upgraded to Club World (Business Class) on the outward trip. An excellent experience: as always the cabin crew make the difference. On all sectors professional well-turned-out staff who were genuinely friendly cheerful and helpful. Food was excellent (chicken or pasta seem to be a thing of the past - I was not offered either) nicely presented and for me in sufficient quantity. Water/orange juice runs on a regular basis washrooms clean and tidy and well-stocked A wide range of entertainment on the KWI-LHR sector (it kept me entertained for a 6-hour flight and because I flew out in April and back in May the selection had changed on the return flight). Smooth flights (the 747's on the KWI-LHR sector although old were well- maintained and everything worked - I really enjoy flying the ""Queen of the Skies"") and plenty of information from the flight deck. Slight delay outbound at Kuwait because of a technical problem but it was resolved: all other sectors were on time. I travelled on a Sunday in both directions so no delays in connections at Heathrow although I had built in sufficient time between flights to allow for delays when I booked my ticket. All in all four excellent flights - BA seem to have improved immensely since I last flew with them in 2014: the cabin crew and check-in staff seem to make the difference and for this reason I use BA in preference to the carriers from the Middle East especially as Terminal 5 at Heathrow is a very civilised place to transfer (at least in my experience).",1
My husband and I booked flights online 3 months ago to travel from Barcelona to Venice. We checked in at the airport 2 hours early and were told to proceed to the gate and wait for our flight. We then lined up and as our tickets were scanned to board the flight we were advised that we were on standby and needed to wait at the side for 5 minutes until everyone had boarded. We had no idea what was going on as we had booked and paid for a full fare flight a long time ago. We were then advised that the flight had been overbooked and we did not have a seat! We were told to go to transit and had to wait 3 hrs for then next flight. We could not believe it! How does an airline book more people on a flight then they are able to accommodate! We were on a holiday and only had very limited time in Venice which had now been reduced by a further 3 hours due to an airline error. We also missed a Gondola Cruise that we had pre-booked online. Once we had finally spoken with the lady at the transit station she then told us that we could get on the next flight however could not sit with each other as the flight was once again full! I'm guessing this means that 2 other people on the next flight would have missed out on their seats also which is not fair on them either! I will not be booking with this company again.,0
"DUS-LIS-DUS and again very nice experience nice and smiling crews fair food and beverages. TAP planes are very quiet inside compared to the same Airbus Types used by e.g. Lufthansa. Monitors at least exist allowing passengers to see the usual movies and the flight routing. Very good value for money. Contrary to others I feel the ""old"" TAP seats are much more comfortable than the thin new seats used by other airlines. One last remark: The onboard magazine is for sure one of the best throughout the world.",1
SQ11 LAX-NRT-SIN 12 May and return on SQ12 19 May. Was my first time flying the A380 despite a few bumps of turbulence near NRT I found it to be an amazingly quiet aircraft. Flight attendants were courteous efficient and professional coming through the cabin frequently with hot towels as well as water/juices to keep passengers hydrated during the 10+ hour flights. They also knew when to leave passengers undisturbed something you don't really see with many carriers. The seating despite being economy class was pretty roomy both flights weren't entirely full so I got some room to stretch out and sleep for a few hours. The only real fly in the ointment was on SQ12 where the aft toilets weren't working. That wasn't too big an issue as the flight wasn't full but I can definitely see where it would be if the plane was chock-a-block packed. All things considered though I really enjoyed the experience on SQ which proves why international carriers especially Asian ones are miles ahead of any U.S. carriers (with the exception of VX and B6). I would definitely recommend SQ to friends and family; I'm really looking forward to trying out their premium economy service when it rolls out maybe one day the suites!,1
Orlando to Manchester on 5th November Flight VS76 with my grandchildren. I will never fly Virgin again. I have given Staff service 1 star but only because the option to give none is not available (like a lot of onboard services). On trying to book in there was a long queue which did not move. No announcements were made and eventually another passenger told us the computer system was down. The ground crew were exceptionally rude and our party was split despite having reserved seats before we left the UK. The cabin crew were almost invisible. They disappeared to their rest area shortly after serving the meal. Call bells were ignored. When they did appear they were disinterested and barely polite. The meal was unappetising. Perhaps if Virgin spent some of the money they spend on advertising and hype on training staff and updating very tired and worn aircraft passenger satisfaction would improve.,0
BKK-HEL-BKK A330 business class flat-bed seats. Three problems with the 10-hour outward flight. When you have to get up around 06.00 for an 09.00 departure the obvious first meal should be breakfast or at the very least brunch. Not so on AY where a full lunch is inexplicably served before 10.00. It then serves a second reduced lunch prior to landing. If the poor lounge served some breakfast foods then perhaps I might understand. But the uncomfortable Louis Tavern has no breakfast food at all! For a long daytime flight a good breakfast is surely a must. Secondly the touch-screen AV selection is poor with almost the worst selection of mostly old movies I have experienced in recent years. Thirdly and least pleasantly the cabin smelt faintly of a toilet throughout most of the flight. I will not take this flight again until meals are more in tune with the time of departure. On the return sector meals were also rather unsatisfactory. Dessert and cheese for dinner each amounted to no more than a couple of mouthfuls. The breakfast scrambled eggs were bland and the croissants served cold. On both flights I found the rather narrow flat bed seats surprisingly uncomfortable. Switching off the AV system a full 25 minutes prior to landing was extremely annoying and seems inexplicable. The rather officious unsmiling purser pointed out this is company policy!,0
A few days ago Toronto was hit with a massive storm and all flights into Pearson had been cancelled. Westjets customer service and the way they handled the situation was excellent. They put all passengers up in a hotel for the night provided taxis and even passed out food vouchers. As this was a weather circumstance this was not expected. Fantastic service.,1
KUL-SIN-KUL. Return flight to Singapore for a day trip. $40 return so cant complain about the price. No issues with check in on both legs. Fairly new A320s which for some reason had very old worn seats (maybe moved from their older retired aircraft). That is probably the only minor complaint. Cabin crew friendly and efficient managed to serve meals and drinks and clean up on a very short 45 min flight. Both flights landed on time. Over all a good experience would fly with them again.,1
Good flight - paid more to select seats ensuring we got the seats we wanted. I got my bags checked in fine all the way to the end destination despite being on a 15 hour transit. Check in crew were not picky over slight overweight of check in bags when they saw that we didn't use full hand carry weight (just a small bag each weighing less than 1kg) so that was good as I didn't want to lug a heavy bag around during transit. Would fly with them again.,1
TXL-ATH-CHQ (Chania Crete) and return in March 2014. New slim line seats with hard seatback and short cushion that doesn't properly support thighs so you are forced to sit in a very unnatural and cramped position. The further back on the plane the smaller legroom gets i.e. new seats + seat in the back = nightmare while older seats in front of the cabin are very comfortable. Apart from that pleasant flights with good service hot pasta meal on TXL-ATH small though but at least one of the few remaining airlines to serve warm meals on intra- european flights. Even on the short ATH-CHQ hop they serve drinks and a cake. As they charge extra fees for every checked bag people carrying incredible amounts of luggage into the cabin making boarding a bit chaotic. Cabin baggage restrictions should be enforced.,1
"LGW-YYZ-LGW Jul 9 and 20 in Club Class. My expectations were not particularly high but were exceeded in almost all areas. Check-in/boarding etc. were fine at both airports and priority baggage delivery also worked well. On board the crews were excellent professional and friendly service was good with edible meals served on china with proper cutlery drinkable wine and some nice touches like hot cookies and Irish coffee mid-way across. Seats are reasonable grey leather with 38"" pitch and in a small cabin of only 12 seats ; not much recline but adequate. A blanket is offered but no pillow an odd omission. The IFE is fine with a fair choice of films/programmes but the headphones are of poor quality and provide insufficient sound. The outbound flight was delayed by bad weather in YYZ but operated on their revised schedule inbound was on time. All in all a good experience which I shall use again.",1
MCT-CDG one way. First time I fly WY in Y class. Good experience. The seat was truly excellent with comfortable cushion and very clever recline system. Pitch seemed good ??I had exit seat. IFE was very impressive: the biggest screen I have seen in Y and fantastic interface even better than QR IFE. However the choice of films was very limited. Food was average but we had enough. FAs were cold and not smiley but my neighbours and I got quickly everything extra we had asked. I would fly WY again.,1
Malaga to Manchester on 19th October. At 6 months pregnant and with a 14 month old toddler I was worried and apprehensive about the flight. My son became distressed during the flight which turned out to be an ear infection and the staff couldn't have been more helpful. Staff came to give some support and discussed ways to soothe my son without being condescending and didn't make a scene.,1
My wife and I took advantage of the non stop from Punta Cana to Dallas. All was fine however were very surprised when we asked for a blanket and were told there was a $5 charge. We were flying in first class first time I have been asked to pay for a blanket when traveling first class and more specifically first calls international.,1
My wife and I recently flew MFM-CTU in business class. The flight departed Macau 40 mins late with no explanation offered to passengers. Once onboard A320 the polite though business like crew assisted passengers in storing carry on items. The aircraft interior could have used a thorough cleaning. Meal service was efficient although flight attendants disappeared once the bland food was served. The pilot and first officer spoke excellent English cabin attendants could have used some tutoring. We chose this carrier because it offered the only choice of non stop service between Macau and Chengdu.,0
"Saint John NB to Cancun Feb 7th and will not fly with Air Canada Rouge again. 4 hour delay in Toronto not due to weather and no explanation to passengers for the reasons for delay. 4.5 hour flight with no hot meal available - experienced the same on the way back on Feb 15. Seats were exactly a coke can and a half between edge of my seat and back of next. I am 5'8"" and my husband is 6'0"" and we were very uncomfortable. No TV and music unless you want to download app and watch on your cell phone. You can rent an ipad for $10 but my experience on the way down and the way back was that everyone around me had problems with them. I'll pay more next time and be able to move my legs.",0
Two legs GRU-REC and REC-BSB-GRU. Aircraft was comfortable but apart from that the service was terrible. Everything is paid for including soft drinks and even coffee although if you are lucky you may get a free glass of water. Many things on the list are never available and they never have change. On the REC-BSB section the shop was not operational so at least we got a free juice - together with some peanuts. No inflight entertainment at all and no information about the route temperatures etc (except on GRU-REC flight). Safety information given in Portuguese only - why? English and Spanish versions are essential for the World Cup and other holiday periods. Another problem - only 3 bathrooms on a B737-800 and one reserved for women only.,0
I flew business class from New York to Dubai. I was so looking forward to it since I heard that it was in a class by itself. What a disappointment. The crew were well scrubbed in their uniforms and led me to my seat. It consisted of a small cube like area with a nice sized video screen. I soon found out that the space was very constricting. My wife was next to me and a partition between us was lowered but not all the way. There was a 4 inch portion that still protruded that did not allow for comfortable placement of my arm. The lie flat seats were not truly lie flat. By the way this was an A380 and the seats were more 175 degrees. The head area seemed a little bit elevated. There was a cushion-mattress that was given to place over the reclined seat that did make it more comfortable but the confined space of the pod like area was uncomfortable. I could not really move my arms very well around my head. I had flown Air New Zealand a few months ago and their business class on a 777 was far superior. When I arrived on New York on the return the flight was an hour late. Even though my baggage was checked thru to Jetblue when I went through customs and tried to recheck the baggage I was told it was too late for it to be transferred to the Jetblue flight. It was 55 minutes to the flight and they needed an hour at least. The Emirates rep said she could not help me. I thought that she could have provided a porter to take the luggage over to Jetblue with me but I had to do that on my own. My next trip to Dubai I am going to try Etihad business and I hope that the experience is better.,0
SV 038 on November 15 SV 560 on November 16 2014. Great service food and all around experience. The check in staff at Dulles Airport were very nice and moved me to a better seat. There were ample blankets and pillows. The food was far superior to other airlines. I really appreciated the lotions and skin fresheners in the bathrooms.,1
My Wife and I have used various Airlines in USA fairly extensively over the years. First time on Alaskan and can only highly recommend them. Service from check in Kerbside to arrival destination was perfect and should ever we visit USA again will use them if opportunity exists.,1
Not recommended as there was a 6-hour delay with my flight from Guangzhou to Singapore and there was no official announcements from the airline even at the last minute. Just kept waiting at the airport without any food or drink provided without any further information. The food on board tasted poor and airline staff on-board spoke very poor English. The in-flight screen showing films during the trip was extremely small and there were no headphones provided. I could not hear the audio of the film and the subtitles are too small and cannot be seen. My worst flying experience.,0
"Our flight from Auckland to Amsterdam on was delayed 8 hours and we missed the connecting flights. We were assured that Thai staff would reconnect our flights at Bangkok so that we wouldn't need to do anything. When we finally left NZ (8 hours later) and reached Bangkok we were provided with a hotel room and free breakfast. That was refreshing and much appreciated. However, Thai Airways arranged for our flights direct to Amsterdam via another airline but unfortunately didn't tell us. So we were running around Bangkok Airport trying to figure out where our new boarding passes were, who was flying with whom and when. We also didn't know what happened to our luggage. Finally, it took 46 hours in total to reach Amsterdam (includes delay, overnight stay, flights in transit) from Auckland. Better communication to stranded passengers would have resulted in an ideal outcome as we were unsure as to how long we would be stranded in Bangkok and the location of our luggage. In saying that, the Thai Airways staff on the plane were friendly, food was fantastic, and the ample refreshments were great. We enjoyed the flight service better than the ground service.",1
"MEL-BKK-MEL in Boeing 777. Business Lounge at Melbourne Airport (shared with Air NZ) is tatty and tired with worn dirty carpets and furnishings very poor snack selection and a general air of neglect. Outbound aircraft was a bit tatty and worn too with the customary small and hard business class seats often found on Asian airlines generally and of course they are at an angle even when ""flat"" so unless you strap yourself in firmly you will slowly slide down onto the floor. Inflight service was adequate but rushed and wine top ups had to be requested. Inflight movies and entertainment was excellent with lots of new release movies. Return flight was in a newer cleaner aircraft but the same issues with seat and service applied. Overall I'd rate Thai as ""OK"" but there are better options.",1
"We recently flew from Singapore to Christchurch New Zealand. We are frequent Business Class travellers and were extremely disappointed with the service on this airline. The cabin crew were very disorganized although obviously not short of staff. Dinner took a long time to be served. We were not given a sample to taste of the wine we ordered and the wine was poured into a glass in the galley and then brought to our seats without even being put on a tray as were all the drinks such as water tea coffee etc. I woke up early while most passengers were sleeping and the hostess asked me whether I would like breakfast even though we were about 4 hours away from our destination. I agreed but then waited two hours for it to be served. The French toast I ordered was inedible the bread rolls and croissant were cold and hard and the coffee was extremely bitter. The flat beds are uncomfortable and you need the help of the cabin staff to put them up or down. The most disappointing thing was when I reported this to the airline they simply sent back an email saying that ""meals are served two and a half hours before landing"". I'm not sure what the problem was on this particular flight as our other flights on Singapore Airlines were good. The flight was on 7th February from Singapore.",0
Flight to Tel Aviv from Manchester. On time crew friendly. I'm a nervous flyer but I felt fine Well done easy jet.,1
"Bait and switch. Spirit gets you to book a flight by offering fares at around 10%-15% lower than everyone else. What they do not tell you is that once you're booked that is when they make up for the ""low"" fare. Our plans changed and we wanted to cancel our rental car, four days before our trip - big charges! We travel with a young child in the autism spectrum. Want to sit with him, extra fees for the ""privilege"" of sitting with him. Bag fees are ridiculous. We all packed in one checked bag. At the desk - over weight - $50 more dollars. Waiting for the plane, which was almost an hour late they made an on ounce net about how the will get another $100 if your carry-on doesn't meet their last minute standards. Coffee in flight? $3 is this Starbucks? I would not be surprised to learn they charge extra for a seatbelt. They ""bait"" you with low entry fees but once you are signed up they ""switch"" to a fee charging machine.",0
Outbound and return flight from Singapore to Taipei in economy class. Flights were seriously delayed both ways without giving passengers due prior notification. On the outbound leg in Singapore we sat in the plane for about 2 hours before we could take off. On-board service was so-so and the food was virtually inedible. No wonder everyone seemed to have ordered a special meal.,0
Quick flights between HNL-OGG and KOA. Very pleasant airline. Smiling crew. Efficient boarding resulting in very punctual departures. Beverages were offered: a lot of efforts are put in these very short flights. Can't wait to try them on longer route! Hawaiian airlines should consider flying to Vancouver!,1
LH721 PEK-FRA Airbus A380. Advance online seat reservation was not working but able to get an aisle during online checkin - which opened earlier than the advertised 23 hours before the flight so most good seats were gone. Seats are very cramped - 31 inch pitch is too small for a long-limbed 6 footer like me. Entertainment system was awful - screen far too close painfully slow the films were old and music content limited audio barely audible. On the plus side staff were excellent.,0
Flight 457 from Los Angeles to Frankfurt was delayed due a technical problem. Unfortunately there was no assistance for me at the arrival gate since my flight connection was half an hour later I had to rush pass again through the security check and immigration. I arrived breathless at the gate of my flight to Florence where we were told that they had to change the aircraft due to a technical problem. I had to wait for another hour. Concerning the service on board and the aircraft (a new B747-800) I have nothing to complain about.,1
NRT to CGK. Service was above my expectations. Food tasted really good with superb presentation. Baggage claim was long but probably its CGK baggage handling system's fault. Return CGK to HND. Everything went perfectly. Overall I'm really pleased with ANA. One improvement could be IFE organization as they list same movie multiple times with different subtitles.,1
"Darwin to Kununurra in an E-170. Comfortable 2-abreast seating and a smooth flight. However there was a confusing beginning in Darwin as the departures screen said ""go to gate"" but did not give a gate number! Eventually a barely audible ""last call"" announcement was made. The service on-board was friendly. A pack of two small muffins and orange juice was served. The flight operated on time.",1
Flew from Miami to Havana via the Caymans. 1.5 hrs and 45 min flights. Very nice check-in staff in MIA - helpful. Nice flights in old but well kept 737-300. Cabin crew middle aged smiling and professional on both flights. Lots of Cubans on flight = lots of luggage. Ground staff obviously knows this and it seemed like one baggage-handler was dedicated - onboard! Only to help pax with finding space in hat racks. Transit in Cayman quite a mess though since no info was given from flight/cabin/ground-staff about well anything. You have to enter the country and leave again as if you had stayed there for a week. The whole process took about 1 hour. The little airports departure hall was overcrowded and contained no info-boards at all.,1
Will never fly again. Flight delayed 2 hours from Flores - no explanation. We left Guatamala on route to JFK with a short stop over in El Salvador - it was an old plane. The plane we got on in El Salvador was even older. Arrived at JFK and waited for our luggage along with about 30 other people. Luggage never got loaded on in El Salvador. Luggage arrived 27 hours later! I understand that things happen but the Avianca people were rude and not the least bit apologetic!,0
"LGW to SZG. Absolutely useless for a scheduled service and would not recommend to anyone. Booked flights to Salzburg for travel in September way back in April and chose the 13.45pm flight as most convenient even though more expensive. Luckily we arranged an overnight stop in Gatwick as we live in the North of England as otherwise don't know what we would have done when our flight was cancelled with notice only being given about 9.30pm the night before. We were put on the 7.15 am flight which meant being at Gatwick for 5am. This is a much cheaper flight but no partial refund is available its take it or leave it with BA. Our subsequent onward travel plans were also in disarray because of this and it was a most unpleasant and stressful start to our holiday. Having taken the trouble to complain to BA I am amazed it took 8 days to send a most unsatisfactory short response which ended with ""we hope you fly with us again to restore your confidence in our service"". BA need to learn that scheduled service means just that and plans are made around the timings that cant just be altered with no notice. I would not trust or travel with them again.",0
MEL-SYD TT228. Having not flown Tiger over the last few years I was very pleased to be able to fly with them again. Cheap airfare even with the add-ons was still cheaper than Jetstar. Friendly check in staff. The Tiger Terminal is basic but serves its purpose. Boarding was very prompt and the flight took off on time. Very engaging cabin crew. Very smooth flight. Landed early into Sydney. All in all a very positive experience on Tiger and would prefer them over Jetstar.,1
SEN-ALC and return. Easyjet gets the job done with minimum fuss. Out on time friendly professional crew. Return flight delayed by almost three hours but informed by text message and received complimentary light refreshments while waiting. Delay handled well and lots of apologies by captain and crew. Service almost on a par with a full service airline.,1
I fly Cubana regularly (2 times/year) since 2003. I never encountered the delays and problems some people from Europe reported. For the food onboard I noticed that the quality out of Montreal seems superior than the one out of Habana - prices are sensibly lower than other airlines for the same quality.,0
"It seems that US Airways doesn't realize that ""flight"" is not the entire customer experience. The experience begins well before the flight and ends well after the flight. We flew to SFO from PHX this week. We were issued boarding passes and noticed we were in Zone 5. Well since the seats are reserved that didn't seem to be a problem until during boarding a gate agent came to my wife and told her that they were checking her bag ""because there wasn't any bin space left"" and we could go to the carousel at SFO to pick it up. My wife's bag is not large but it does have rollers and it seemed they were ""confiscating"" every bag in Zone 5 with rollers. We boarded the aircraft and discovered there was loads of bin space. I approached the First Class Cabin attendant and said I'd like to retrieve my wife's bag he said ""no it's already gone."" I asked why they were telling passengers there wasn't any bin space when there clearly was plenty of space. He offered a ""well they don't actually check it's just that at about this time in boarding there isn't much space left."" On arrival in SFO we thought well at least as the last bag loaded it'll be the first one off the carousel again we were mistaken. At least 50 bags came off before our bag and not a quick 50 bags. We discovered on our return flight (we returned from San Jose Airport) the same protocol was used by the gate attendant. Our bag was the last carry on allowed all the others were collected and checked. We realized at that point since there was plenty of bin space again that this is a ""convenience"" move by US Air their convenience they don't risk a late ""push back"" if people are seated faster. Of course ""their convenience"" translates into ""our inconvenience."" Why not board 5 minutes earlier? The plane was there all arriving passengers had been off for at least 30 minutes prior to our boarding. Moral of the story - my wife said ""I don't care how much more it is to fly Southwest we're never flying US Airways again.""",0
4 March 2015 Flight 6E178. 6 March 2015 Flight 6E665. I flew from Mumbai to Delhi back and forth and it was great. The seats were comfortable (I took the first row seat with more leg space) the crew were very pleasant and we arrived on time. On the way back I arrived 3 hours earlier in Delhi and they were kind enough to let me go on the next flight so I didn't have to wait at the airport. Overall my experience with Indigo was 5 stars!,1
My reservation was lost although they billed my card twice and I had to pay the higher last minute fare. Both flights delayed. They lost my luggage and it was not found for 3 days. There is no on site help desk for lost luggage just a phone number (not toll free) which no one answers after leaving a handful of messages. After returning to the airport the next day I was told to call the complaint number - it is only open for 3 hours a day and a recording told me there was an hour wait. Fly an airline that is customer centric if you don't want to get surprised like I did.,0
Economy return trip from UK to Manila via Beijing. Overall we were very impressed and it is on a par with other airlines. All flights were on time and none were full to capacity. The food was standard although no hot drinks served. All cabin crew were very helpful. We could not check-in online (machine not working) and had difficulty with the automatic machines at Heathrow which accepted only one of our passports. The queues at the check in at Manilla on the return flight were extensive and although not vast numbers were flying we were still waiting in line for about an hour as so few check-in kiosks open. Beijing is a very large airport but times passing through security etc is very slow. One lady (by herself) was operating the X-Ray machine and she was also manually checking everything in the hand luggage she wanted to query. She was very thorough but it caused long delays. We had only just enough time to get our connection (final boarding) - which was 90 minutes. On the outward flight we had 8 hours to kill at Beijing Airport. In the evening the shops seem to shut but we did find some recliner chairs which afforded us the opportunity for rest.,1
I flew SWA from Tampa to Baltimore in April. It went well except for the boarding. We were delayed leaving because at the end of boarding one passenger didn't get a seat. That was because their system is not assigned seating it's open seating so nobody has a particular seat and nobody can prove which seat they are entitled to. From the announcements that followed it appeared that the problem was the lap babies-ones that were given free or low fares because they were supposed to be kept on their mother's lap (is that safe?). There were a lot of children on this flight. Apparently one of the mothers decided to give her child a seat instead taking up a paying passenger's seat. Without any way to prove which mother was the culprit the poor lady without a seat was given something they called an emergency seat. It didn't sound like it was very comfortable. If you fly SW do get priority boarding or you could end up in a seat like that.,0
PER-MEL. We flew these flights last week. The flights were on time and the service was outstanding. The food was delicious and the entertainment was designed to make the time fly. Really great flights!,1
GA 331 SUB-CGK on 23rd May 2015. Different from the first leg this flight was extremely enjoyable. The check in was as smooth as melted butter. The boarding and departure was uneventful and on time. The cabin crews were attentive lively and polished. They gave me 2 pieces of bread which were delicious. The flight was practically empty so I had a row for myself I could lean back straighten my legs watching a movie while enjoying a cup of hot tea. Landed smoothly. I booked an economy class but they gave me a first class experience.,1
"Delayed, further delayed and then cancelled due to fog even though other airlines were landing and taking off. Poor communication throughout. Thankfully able to use another airline but later than expected at destination. The route has only been going about two weeks and half my flights have been cancelled.",0
CX170 and CX888 PER-HKG-YVR on A330 and 777ER. Firstly Qantas lounge at Perth is ordinary but did the job for an hour. Trip from PER to HKG was quite good with food okay service friendly & seat being comfortable. HKG to YVR was excellent all round again and slept 7 of the 11 hours. Overall very good but find that the 777ER is significantly more spacious and comfortable seat then the A330 (due to cabin width). I would also recommend getting an extra duvet or 2 (you get 1 initially) as these are quite thick and can be used as a type of mattress when sleeping it really made the world of difference on the 2nd leg for me.,1
My wife and I flew South African Airways to Perth Australia in April and returned in May. Both flights were excellent we really enjoyed the flights. The cabin staff were very good entertainment excellent. We will be flying South African Airways again.,1
"My boyfriend and I were traveling to Chicago for a long weekend. After having to pay over $90 to carry on our luggage when we checked in at the airport, we went to the gate to find that our flight was delayed. No one told us this. It was delayed once more, and again no announcement was made. Their website flight status information differed from the board at the gate, so for a good hour or more we had no idea what time our flight was supposed to leave. After all this, the flight was cancelled right before midnight. Spirit did absolutely nothing for us. They couldn't put us on a flight the next morning. My boyfriend asked if they could put us on a flight anywhere in the country instead, all we wanted was a long weekend away. They couldn't do that either. We cancelled and flew JetBlue instead.",0
"I booked my trip through Orbitz. The trip was ""must be there on time"" type of trip. I was very pleased that check in was made easy to do online I had no problems with baggage as I carried only 1 bag with me. We traveled from DFW to Charlotte NC then onto Charleston WV. The plan for the first leg of the trip was excellent my only critique would be on that 2nd leg of the trip which was in a much smaller plane and the seats were pretty ""snug"". However we were on time the entire way there. On the way back our trip was delayed from leaving almost 2 hrs but there had been storms that had come through which had thrown many other flights off and I guess that was natures fault. All the staff was very friendly. They served only a beverage as our trips were short and I didn't mind. I would recommend us airways to anyone and look forward to flying with them again.",1
Hong Kong - Denpasar return. The flight out of HKG was delayed about 20 min and they bussed passengers to a remote boarding location rather than using a jetway. The flight was fairly full. As a rather tall Western man I'd have enjoyed another inch of pitch or an exit row seat. FAs attentive starting drinks and meal service shortly after takeoff. Throughout the flight they made frequent rounds with drinks. B737 was clean no personal IFE though. The flight back was extremely uncomfortable because the temperature in the front of the economy section was too hot. When I went to the lavatory I noticed that the rear of the cabin was much cooler. Not sure what was up with that. The verdict: not a bad regional airline good crew potential to be improved in a few areas but fine for a short flight if the fare is right. I'd give them another try.,1
Caught the Dubai to Adelaide 300-777 Sept 18 2014. After the A380 experience this was definitely a louder bumpier ride! Seats were smaller and more cramped. People had far to much cabin baggage which really annoyed me on this flight as it was us who had stuck to the rules of 7kg limit 1 bag who had to separate our luggage and have it stashed all over the plane. I feel this should be policed by the terminal staff. Our luggage was only ever weighed leaving Adelaide airport. The people in front reclined their seats fully for the whole trip and they were not asked to sit upright when we were trying to eat which had happened on other recent flights. The galley was very noisy especially in down time when the passengers where trying to sleep. The toilets were very noisy when flushed and although we were seated away from the toilet we still constantly got woken by them. Ambience was lovely. Plane was clean and fresh looking although a little worn around the edges. Food was tasty and a lot of it. Drinks were regular but cold drinks were warm. Seemed a common problem on all our flights. Staff were friendly and attentive just loud. My entertainment screen was broken and wouldn't work by touch once I worked out the hand set this was ok. The audio was broken and static I had to listen to one ear input only! This was a shame as the other experiences I had were great and despite this I would still fly Emirates and recommend them to friends.,1
"QF 8 DFW-SYD via BNE 19 Jan. Speedy check-in at DFW in a deserted Terminal D. Lounge was packed with Club members even-so adequate seating was available as this lounge meanders through a number of connected rooms only gripe was lack of restrooms. 747-400 upper deck seats 16JK (a good choice as the area to the left of these seats is crew rest area so noise from the galley behind is minimal and the lavatory is at the front of the cabin) in the new configuration. Friendly seasoned flight attendants immediately made us feel welcome home after a five week RTW holiday going ""the extra mile"" throughout the 15.5 hour flight. Drinks on boarding and full dinner service after take off with the option of 'small plates' throughout the night and hot breakfast as desired prior to the descent. I managed a good seven hours sleep although a fractious toddler did disturb others. Baggage was on the carousel shortly after clearing passport control. Once again a great QF experience and exceptional value.",1
A fantastic flight Tampa to Boston. Our trip home was also smooth and fun for the kids and parents. Flight attendants professional and nice and the pilots informative.,1
ATL-ICN. My trip back to Korea offered the same meals entertainment and professional hospitality expected on Korean Air. The only difference and an important one at that was something everyone should note. I had a window seat (left side of the plane) and it was so hot from the sun that the window was hot to the touch for about 5-6 hours. Sleeping was difficult and made the area noticeably warmer. Obviously not Korean Air's fault but still important to note.,1
Flew from Toronto Pearson to Milan Malpensa direct. I must say I have no complaints whatsoever ok the food was average but its airline food so why complain. The whole experience was pleasant.,1
BRS-BRU return (twice). These flights are operated by bmi aircraft and crews. All flights on time or a little early. Embraer aircraft are a fairly small but I like them particularly if they are not full (only one of these four flights was nearly full); they are light smooth and the leg room is fine for a short flight. My one complaint is the price one of my trips was economy (B.Light) and the other economy plus (B.Light+). Although the latter was over twice the price (and even economy is not particularly cheap) there was virtually no difference in the quality of service - a bit more food and that is it. I believe the hand luggage weight limit is a bit higher but if you check-in online nobody knows. So my advice is buy the cheapest ticket; though as previous commentators have said that is not always possible.,1
"We were set to travel from Vegas to Dallas then to Orlando then to Gatwick. The nightmare started on our first flight, flight was delayed due to cabin crew being late, when we got to Dallas we had missed our connection due to the previous flight delay, we then get told we can go on the next flight but it was fully booked so we would be put on standby. We made them aware we had more connections to get to, they couldn't of cared less! After my partner explaining we needed to get home due to commitments etc they put us on a direct flight, after they booked it then told us it was to Heathrow airport which is 45 mins from where our car was in Gatwick. Advised that the airline would pay for our bus journey so we took it. When we arrived in Heathrow our nightmare continued as American airlines had now lost our luggage. When we realised the luggage was missing we went to a help desk just to file a report and to be told to go home and our luggage should arrive later that day and all will be ok. Well I've been home a day now and numerous phone calls to American Airlines have not been helpful to us.",0
Paris-Cairo: Airbus 300 configuration 2-4-2. Personal IFE offers excellent choice of video games good choice of movies. Meal was very good. Seats ok footrest is a real plus. Twice my IFE stopped working (problem with touching screen) and in 5 minutes crew updated it. Some passengers got pillow + cover some other didn't. No alcohol served onboard.,1
"Flew London Heathrow - Cologne Bonn on Monday 8th September. Had checked in online and printed my boarding card 2 days before but as I had a suitcase to go in the hold I still needed to queue at the baggage drop-off point/check in desk. Flight left on time and was smooth throughout. The plane seemed new and was clean. My fare included a snack (choice of cheese or ham roll) a small packet with 3 boiled sweets (not quite sure why) and a small bottle of water. I chose the cheese sandwich which was ""ok but could be better"". After the complimentary snack service the crew came round offering hot and cold drinks - including alcoholic drinks - although not sure if any of these were complimentary. We landed 1 hour after departure from Heathrow slightly less time than advertised. I have scored the in-flight entertainment a 1 purely because being a short flight there wasn't any and the website won't allow me to submit my review without a score. Based on my experience I would consider flying with German Wings again.",1
Travel to Florida in February 2014 and our flight was 2 hours late leaving Halifax and 2 hours late leaving Florida on the return. Tried Sunwing again in April of 2014 for a vacation to Cuba. Our flight was 3 hours late leaving Halifax and our flight was 3 hours late leaving Cuba. Never again will we fly with Sunwing.,0
My wife and I flew from Singapore to Bali on 23rd December 2014 - never again. First problem was with an officious male steward who although I knew where my seat was insisted on looking at our tickets telling me that was why he was stood there and then proceeded to direct us to the starboard side of the plane rather than the port side where our seats A + B were which resulted in us having to walk on down the plane on the wrong side and then cut through and then try to walk back up the plane against the flow of passengers to get to our seats. Second problem was on our return flight to Singapore on the evening of the 27th all the passengers were hanging around for hours at Bali airport as there was a problem with the plane. Not a problem until we heard that the flight was cancelled and that we would be moved to hotels. No one who could speak English or Dutch was available to liaise with the passengers to advise us of the arrangements. The crowd sort of drifted towards the exit but no one came to tell us about reclaiming our baggage or times of the buses etc. We then drifted towards to baggage reclaim hall down some service steps and then had to find where the cases were coming in. We then drifted towards the exit and then the fun started. The buses turned up again with no explanation and we were trampled on by the Dutch in their efforts to get on the buses. We eventually got on to a bus. but had to stand with our luggage dumped along the aisles. We then were again trampled on by them in their effort to get into the hotel so we stood back to let them fight it out. We then eventually got our room but no mention of how we were getting back to the airport the following day. We did get a phone call from KLM telling us we needed to be at the airport first thing in the morning to get a flight with Silk Air. We got a taxi back and thankfully the flight went OK no thanks to the very poor communication skills shown by KLM. Problems arise and safety is of course paramount but if there was some one there who could lead the tired passengers through the situation and keep them informed the matter would have been far less traumatic instead it was the blind leading the blind.,0
AI 675 Mumbai - Kolkata on 17th January 2015. The aircraft an A320 was in excellent condition. It was spotless and the seats were very clean and so was the entire cabin. The crew were excellent always smiling and helping the guests. The seats provided extreme comfort with ample leg space. The only suggestion that comes to my mind is AI should make sure that they change the menu because the last time I flew AI 675 in Nov' 2014 the same breakfast was served (Non Veg). The flight was extremely comfortable. The return leg was on 23rd January 2015 (AI 775). The flight was delayed by about 90 minutes however I have no complaints because AI kept informing me through regular calls and texts about the exact status. The aircraft used in this leg was an old A319. The seats were torn and in some cases even the back rest was not upto the mark. I don't understand if AI can use their 787s in other domestic routes why not in the BOM-CCU sector? If not then why can't the A319s be replaced with the A320s which provide much better comfort. This is just a suggestion as I love flying AI. I would also like to appreciate the fact that in spite of the flight being delayed by 0 minutes we were served dinner on board. The dinner was excellent. Last but not the least I'd like to request AI to please reintroduce the entertainment system for the domestic sectors also so that we can enjoy the flight even more.,1
I was on a return flight from Rome to Istanbul. I had booked a ticket on the website with an approximate 1% discount for EU citizens 25 or under for which I am a British EU citizen who was 25 at the time. On my flight to Istanbul I had to wait for quite a while at the counter to get my boarding pass. I do not speak Italian and the staff spoke among themselves in Italian for a long while without telling me what the problem was in fact not admitting there was a problem. There wasn't a big line so this didn't delay other passengers. Eventually they issued me my boarding pass. Ok a bit of a pain but not such a big deal. The flight was without incident. On my return flight Istanbul to Rome I got to the counter to collect my boarding pass and there was another holdup. The staff spoke amongst themselves for much longer than the first flight approximately 30-45 minutes. Again they wouldn't admit there was a problem and I asked several times what the supposedly non existent problem was with no luck. Again they spoke in their own language to each other and on the phone so I couldn't eavesdrop. They also made several phone calls. I was getting pretty anxious because I thought there was a serious problem. As there were only a small number of counters in operation for Alitalia in Istanbul at the time the line ballooned out as a result of the holdup and I wonder if some passengers missed their flights. Eventually the counter staff asked me if I was a student. I said no. They then told me to go and buy a new ticket without explaining why. When I pried them they told me it was because I had purchased a discount ticket without the right to do so. I then explained to them that Alitalia had offered an approximate 1% discount on their website for EU citizens 25 and under and the discount had nothing to do with being a student. The lady at the counter then made another call then issued me my boarding pass without apologising. I am not sure if it was the same problem on the outbound flight but It does seem rather odd that the staff appeared not aware of their own policy regarding the 25 and under discount for EU citizens (maybe the policy changed?) which is quite a common discount that many companies and organisations offer in the EU. Also if they had have admitted what the problem was from the beginning I could have resolved the whole thing right away. It also appeared to me to be a poor use of judgement to hold up the line for such a considerable amount of time over the question of a discount of approximately 1 euro. This upset me greatly. Otherwise the flight itself was without incident.,0
We were due to fly Dublin - Charlotte - Orlando on 25th July. When we got to the airport our flight to Charlotte was delayed by 4 hours. Went to US Airways desk to mention we would miss our connection she was so helpful and got us to Gatwick with Aer Lingus and onto Orlando with British Airways. Returning home on 8th Aug and we had no problems Orlando to Charlotte on American Airlines and US Airways to Dublin. Having heard all the horrid reviews I wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised by my experience. I found US Airways flight attendants so nice and the flight was lovely.,1
May 12th LY32. May 21 LY31. We were very disappointed with our flights to and from Tel Aviv. The seats are the most uncomfortable seats that you can possibly sit in. The seats need to be re-stufffed. They have been this way for a very long time and we do not plan to fly El Al until we are assured that the problem is fixed. As well there were problems with the electrical system as when we tried to read the lights kept going off.,0
My son had a very expensive round-trip ticket for Thanksgiving break: Spokane to Los Angeles with transfers in Phoenix. We confirmed the flights online. We tried to check in at the airport on Dec 1 for the return flight at least 30 min early (6am). My son had only one carry-on and a backpack. Theoretically he could use the automatic kiosk to get his boarding pass and go directly through security. They had already sold his ticket. The woman behind the counter wasted our time. It took 10 more minutes to call the supervisor. They were rude and told us we should have been there 45 min early. They gave my son a standby ticket for flights when the Phoenix transfer was at 9pm with no chance of getting aboard. That would mean he would be sitting at the airport from 6am to 9pm! I had to pay a change of flight fee $225 plus $250 for the next day.,0
SYD-SCL (Santiago)-SYD on QF27/28 again in Premium Economy. This almost feels like a 'flagship route' for Qantas these days. These flights are excellent and interesting and offer (if one is lucky) unbelievable views of the Antarctic Ice Shelf especially at this time of the year as the aircraft follows the necessary 'Great Circle Route' to and from Australia. Top professional service and a sense of a quality product on these 747 flights .I only wonder why Qantas doesn't offer Premium Economy Seating on its A330 flights into Asia as does Cathay Pacific. I'm sure it would be a winner.,1
Medellin to Cartagena business class. Quick check in and near security. Good bag allowance. Upgraded at gate drinks service on short flight. Great seats and all announcements in Spanish and English. Much better that any USA carrier would compare with a good BA flight.,1
DFW-Doha-Cochin Prompt boarding both ways. Delightful crew and great food. No complaints. However transfer at Doha could be a nightmare due to having to go security again.,1
I flew with Brussels from GVA via BRU to DKR and thereon from PNR via BRU to GVA. I have to admit that this was a very pleasant experience. The inflight personnel were very polite and helpful ready to attend to any request. The only question that they were unable to answer on my flight from PNR to GVA via BRU was which city would organize the Olympics of 2020 since I was flying back on that exact date. Having flown with SQ/LH/AF/TK/LX I would rate them equal to SQ business class.,1
"I have been flying JFK to Dulles now for 4 weeks on the Friday 2.29 departure. It has never left on time and is generally 1 hour late. On Friday 8/8/14 it left 3 hours late. On two occasions the problem has been mechanical. One time because we needed to put more fuel on as we were given a new flight route. 140 mins longer than originally planned. I guess we were cutting it close before the re-route. All in all it is a bad flying experience. Their tag line should read ""you would be better off driving"".",0
We flew ADL-KUL-IST then CDG-KUL-ADL and we found MH to be very good. All flights were on time and the staff were very attentive coming around with drinks virtually every hour. The food served was quite good although the infamous MH chicken or mushroom roll was served on 2 legs and was just average. The aircraft's were all clean and modern so really no complaints at all.,1
This was my second Swiss Business-class experience long-haul and intra-Europe in four years and the improvements in all facets were both subtle and noticeable. Their resumption of SIN services appears to be paying off with excellent loads both ways (previous trip was ex-HKG). Outwards SIN-ZRH LX179 was on the oldest A340 (HB-JMA) but you would not have known it from the immaculate cabin. Cabin crew an absolute delight with a range of ages and genders and every one with whom I interacted was cheerful and charming the friendly teamwork was a joy to observe. The addition of a seat controls briefing card?to the seat-pocket contents was a welcome and helpful addition to the reconfigured A340. Choose an outboard single seat if travelling alone I had 9K on the LX179 and 11K on the return LX178 and enjoyed a decent 5hrs snooze on the former and almost 8hrs solid sleep on the latter. In Europe the ZRH-TXL (and later return) sectors demonstrated why Swiss has been awarded Best European Business Airline. Crew interaction details (jackets lockers water bottles reading materials chocolates) and short- sector catering were all happy experiences. The return LX178 ZRH-SIN crew didn't quite make par with their 179 counterparts a fortnight earlier but their colleagues had set a very high bar. Both food and wine were very good indeed. Transfers at ZRH were flawless and the ?worlds longest attended bar?above the J and F lounges is worth adjusting a connecting flight to allow an hour or two extra enjoyment.,1
Wonderful surprise! I arrived in Madrid from London with a connection time of 65 minutes but went through the security with no hassles and everything was clearly signed at the Madrid airport with many flight information boards. Boarded easily and settled down into 2A right next to the window but a squeeze to actually get into the seat because of the herringbone conformation. A good seat with a 6 ft bed and soft pillow and blanket . Warm welcome from the all female flight crew in Spanish and English and then some bubbly and a delicious lunch very healthy food and not too heavy and decent Spanish wines. We left on time and arrived almost on time in Santo Domingo. I read much of the way. The seat had many little spots to put things. Delicious afternoon tea before landing and I was very impressed.,1
We flew LHR-HKG and HGK-SYD 11/12 January 2015. We were previously booked on Malaysian Airlines and took the option from Flight Centre to change after their misfortunes during 2014. Wish we had stayed with Malaysian. Found Cathay Pacific in-flight service and overall comfort to be far inferior to our previous international flights with both Singapore Airlines and Thai Airways. In addition we booked and paid for extra leg-room on the legs to/from Australia. When checking-in at LHR I noticed that we had not been allocated these seats and to make matters worse my wife and I were allocated different rows. Upon questioning this I was told that HKG was not open at that time so take it up with them when we arrive. The flight was delayed and upon arrival in HKG we were quickly and rudely ushered to our awaiting flight to SYD. The Cathay staff at the Gate would not assist even though they admitted a mistake had been made and other people were now in the seats we paid for but they would not move them. We therefore spent the flight crammed into the middle of the middle rows in seats several rows apart. Never again will we fly with Cathay Pacific and very little positive to say based on our experiences.,0
One-way CPH-FLL flight on Norwegian. It was by far the worst experience I have had onboard any aircraft. The aircraft flown was not a Dreamliner as I was lead to believe - it was an unmarked charter HiFly plane with an absolute minimum level of comfort. I had paid for a Premium seat which I had flown and enjoyed on previous Norwegian flights - but as the aircraft was substituted only a few premium seats were available and primarily occupied by Norwegian employees with their badges showing. The rest of us including those who were supposed to be seated in Premium were forced to sit in sub-par coach seats. It's not as much being denied the expected level of comfort but the behavior of an airline that downgrades its paying customers with no notice and no options while comfortably taking care of its employees on an 11 hour transatlantic flight. The only bright spot was the onboard Service Director who was very kind and actually told me how sorry he was for what even he agreed was a horrible experience for customers on-board.,0
Flew MEL-SIN-MEL on QF 35 and QF 36. Staff were professional meals were ok. My travel was booked with a partner airline (who performed the next two legs of the journey) and as such when I tried to purchase extra leg room seating was refused. The only saving grace was that both flights were not full and was able to move to spare seats. Top marks for effort for those on the transfer desk in Singapore. Realistically there is more room between the sates of a V-line country train than economy class on Qantas.,1
TK 0035 IST Ataturk-Montreal June 17 2014. Booking the flight one month in advance: both my travel agent and I tried to secure an exit row seat. I expected to pay for it. The airline was impossible to reach from Canada. At check-in the seat selected by the travel agent was changed to an unacceptable one. A request to upgrade for business cabin was denied. On the ground at Ataturk a long and very slow line-up in the corridor just to enter the gate (an additional security check - we have gone through the passport control as well as the security already). Not a single seat available. The security agents behaved like Canadian immigration officials interrogating people about purposes of their trips but no information was going into computers. Younger people were sitting on the floor older ones standing there with their bags looked tortured already. The plane was jammed full. The seats in Economy were really cramped no legroom (a 10hr flight). Rude FA's and completely devoid of smiles. Dismissive and unhelpful to boot trying to ignore passengers as much as possible. Dirty lavatories with pileups of used paper towels on top of garbage boxes no toilet seats available.,0
I often fly with Adria (50 flights per year). Since Adria is member of Star Alliance there are pretty good connections to the most destinations in Europe. The onboard service is good staff quiet nice. Home base airport in Ljubljana has been upgraded and is getting more international. The business lounge is not on the level it should be - old furniture bad food choice dark. The 3 stars that have been given to Adria are correct.,0
Boston-Rome July 2014. Don't book extra comfort seats (this is not economy plus). The seats that are near the exit on the window sides are looking right into the bathroom. Food was bad but movies and drinks were fine.,1
"Checking in on a 5.15 am flight took 40 minutes waiting in line. There was only one check-in person these first 30 minutes with a line about 50 deep. A flight to Myrtle Beach will always have dozens of sets of golf clubs to be checked in. This should be accommodated for. The last 10 minutes of my waiting a second check-in worker became available. On my return flight back to Logan Airport after midnight we passengers had to wait one hour and five minutes on the plane before deboarding. The reason? The (one and only??) person responsible for operating the jet bridge called in sick according to the pilot. No coverage was found. The ""supervisor"" needed to be awoken from home to come to the airport to operate the jet bridge. The smaller and less comfortable non reclining seats and little leg room multiplied the bad accommodation. My first and last flights using Spirit.",0
Delhi - Goa. Easy check in at Delhi Airport We had booked business class tickets which gives you a seat in between a little extra legroom. Food was good you do not pay for it in business as was the seat. Overall a pleasant journey and would use them again.,0
DXB-JNB and on to DUR. The Dubai-Johannesburg was on an Emirates code share flight so I will not review it here but the JNB-DUR was on a proper SAA flight and they have always delivered a high quality product they are attentive and extremely helpful even with the meal. We are Muslims but forgot to ask for a Muslim meal but their flight attendant brought us a vegetarian choice from Economy Class.,1
The service on this short (less than 2 hour) flight and the delicious meal is what made the SQ flight experience outstanding. For the old 777-200 with the very old business class is certainly nothing to brag about.,1
A319 WDH-JNB. Friendly cabin crew flying time just 1hr 35min yet a 4 course meal served with drinks and 3 choices of main course was served - however food of dubious quality with bland taste. Captain kept passengers informed about storms en route - all in all not a bad experience.,1
GIG-SSA. Bought the ticket on-line. While the booking process is less torturous than in the past the website is still full of traps that make many people give up in frustration. GOL was once known as Brasil's low-cost airline but prices are now the same as its competitor TAM. The check-in line at GIG was fairly long. The check-in agent was very helpful and allowed me to take a large bag as carry-on instead of checking it to save me the overweight luggage charge. The boarding process was efficient. The aircraft was clean and comfortable. GOL used to serve free beverages and a light snack but on this flight we were handed a menu and all refreshments had to be purchased. I chose a sandwich combo that included a tasteless sandwich a bag of chips and a can of Pepsi for 20 reais (approx US $15.00 a rather steep price for the mediocre quality). The flight crew was pleasant. We landed on-time in SSA. Overall GOL provides a reasonable service but it's no longer the low-cost airline many assume it to be.,0
A disappointing first Porter experience. Ready to take airport shuttle from Guelph to Toronto at 10 am when we happened to check our email at 9.15 am and found an email sent at 9.02 am saying flight cancelled and if we wanted to take a later flight we had to go to web check in. Tried to go to web check in but only one of two of our reserved seats showed up and there were no two available seats next to each other and web check in would not let us proceed to next screen. Had to call Porter and was told two seats beside each other weren't available and to speak to FA when boarding. Refunded both seat reservation fees but not willing to compensate in any other way. Told that flight was cancelled because of a maintenance issue. Enough to make a suspicious person suspicious - trying to consolidate flights? Won't fly Porter again.,0
Athens - Thessaloniki 17/10 Flight FR1066. Thessaloniki - Athens 20/10 Flight FR 1067. Aircraft always full. All fees charges and extras up front. Ready for take off within 10 minutes of first passenger setting foot in aircraft. Cabin crew move like greased lightning. Punctual. Aircraft emptied quickly. Be absolutely certain you have boarding pass printed out before arriving at airport otherwise you are slaughtered for about 75 quid each which is about the total cost of a cheap printer.,1
My wife and I flew starclass / business from Melbourne to Bangkok return.it was much better than we had expected cannot see what people complain about if they had the same service as we did. You are not paying several thousands return on these flights so what you receive is very good value for money from Jetstar. We have already booked one way flights from Honolulu to Brisbane after a cruise next year in star class and we are looking forward very much to that flight. Inflight and ground crews were all very good.,1
Took return flights to Australia via KL. Don't understand how MA qualify for 5 star rating. Outbound flights 17 Oct were both night flights from Heathrow and KL MH001 and MH123. First time travelling Business Class and didn't come up to expectations. Crew were noticeable by their absence and surly when present. Hospitality from the crew was minimal and not a smile in sight. Quality and choice of the food was disappointing lacking imagination. Return flights from Melbourne 04 Dec via KL. Both daytime flights MH148 and MH004 Crew were much better they seemed to want to deliver a good personable service making both return flights more enjoyable. Unfortunately the food again lacked imagination and therefore disappointing. To summarise standards of the crews on aircraft are inconsistent so its pot luck whether you have an enjoyable flight or not and food was consistently poor.,0
"My wife and I have flown Spirit to several destinations over many years. Most recently we traveled to San Francisco via Las Vegas. I wish we could get direct flights to the Bay Area but an overnight stay in Las Vegas is not too hard to take. Our return trip was not so un-troubled. It's true that the current policy of ""your fare entitles you to a seat on the plane - all else is an extra charge"" seems unfair to some travelers but Spirit is up front about it and nobody should feel they were trapped into unexpected charges for e.g. luggage. We travel with one checked bag (just under the 40 lb. limit) and each have a free backpack as carry-on. Those back packs are big enough to hold water bottles snacks a change of clothes in case of ""delayed luggage"" medication toiletries books etc. We only reserve seats together on longer flights and take our chances on the short hops. That saves us $40 on a round-trip. We have never been treated by any Spirit employee in any way but a courteous and helpful manner. I wish I could say the same about major airline personnel. I don't mind paying $8 for a gin and tonic while flying (it's cheaper if my wife joins me). I've paid more than that at airport bars. Our last return trip from Oakland to Philadelphia was our worst experience. We had anticipated about a 7 hour layover in Las Vegas and planned to hop a shuttle to one of the hotels have dinner and maybe spend some time in the casino before getting a shuttle back to the airport. Weather conditions all over the country played havoc with those plans and the schedules of all airlines as well. There were a few passengers embarrassingly stupid enough to take out their frustration caused by the weather on the crew. We arrived at Las Vegas with just about enough time to check in for the LAS to PHL flight. Since I could not book the trip as a fight from OAK to PHL changing planes in LAS I had to book it as two separate flights. I doubt if Spirit or any airline would take responsibility for us if we missed our flight from LAS to PHL since they did not schedule it as a connection they planned for our journey. If we missed the plane we had designated as a ""connection"" the fault would be ours. That's something to keep in mind if you are planning a trip on Spirit or any airline that uses a lot of ""hub and spokes"" in designing their routes. Overall we have been pleased with the service and prices that Spirit offers the public. The ""hardships"" we have had to endure have been minor and well worth the savings. I hope to start planning our next trip very soon.",1
Flew from Luxembourg to Rio and back to London in January. Long-haul flights were on Alitalia's brand new A330 which is a very nice plane. Sadly the overall experience wasn't great - the staff looked bored and disappeared for most of the flight the food was pretty disgusting (and I'm not a fussy eater) the in-flight entertainment system was very sticky (cue people hitting the screen behind your head for half the flight) and the selection of films was poor. The flights were ridiculously cheap so perhaps you get what you pay for in which case maybe this review should be an overall 9.,1
As a paraplegic I have no complaints about how the airline handled me. I have flown Air Canada for years and all that has come to a stop I flew AC 1891 on October 25th 2014. Tampa to Toronto. While I do not fault the airline for its taking off late (was boarded first 30 minutes late) As a result of rainy weather (I assume) we sat waiting on the runway for an hour. Once we did take off there was one food cart don't order food as I have found all the items disgusting (especially the veggie wrap). They also had one beverage cart. Food cart came first. I like to have a glass of wine or at least water while I fly. One hour and ten minutes in to the flight I was finally offered a beverage. I am 5 ft 4 and 125 pounds and I was packed in to the seat. If you are over 5 ft 9 I would not book AC rouge. There was zero entertainment on board. As I am accustomed to watching a film when I fly I did not bring reading material. No TV. No music no view nothing. Also to add insult to injury I flew AC rouge last time business class and don't bother. Seats are three across with a pillow in the middle seat. The seats are not comfortable and the price outrageous!,0
I have flown 4 Aeromexico flights in the past 6 months two roundtrips from Mexico City to Chicago and all 4 flights were excellent. One flight left 30 minutes late yet managed to arrive on time. The others left on time and arrived either on time or early. Newspapers and either breakfast or a light lunch onboard. Very friendly flight crews. No problems at all.,1
VIE-AMS one way bought just few days before departure so quite expensive. Long bus ride from terminal 3 to somewhere in the middle of Vienna airport to board an old Fokker 100. I don't mind flying unusual types of aircraft's but given the engine configuration of Fokker (rear mounted engine) and the fact that I was seated in the 3rd from the back means it was extremely noisy thorough the entire flight. What bothered me the most was that the seats do not have any moveable headrests. Seat pitch poor but unfortunately that is typical to all intra-Europe economy today. Inedible snack and one round of drinks offered during the flight.,0
BOM-BLR return. I booked with Jet Airways in order to gain some miles with United. Boarding at BOM began 45 minutes before the flight and everyone was seated (at 100% load) 15 minutes later. We sat at the gate another 30 minutes hooked to the jet bridge. The aircraft held 8 in F and 162 in the back on a 737-800 and I have never seen such tight seat pitch. Boarding is done in a single group thus people are scattered up and down the aisle trying to stow carry on baggage. It's a zoo with folks lining back up the jet bridge. Cabin crew was still trying to secure the cabin for landing 30 seconds before landing. Plenty of cabin advertising. As it is it appears to be the Indian version of a low cost Irish carrier.,0
Travelled on flight AC034 Sydney to Vancouver on October 14 the staff were not very friendly or happy. Moving around or using the bathroom was very difficult as the seat belt signs were kept on for most of the flight even when the conditions weren't turbulent. Some of the staff were rude and unhelpful.,0
I was booked on a flight from Singapore to Brisbane in September. This was also my first time taking this airline. My family was a family of three. The plane operated for my flight was a refurbished Boeing 747 and was quite excited at that time as it was a refurbished aircraft. the economy class seats have a touchscreen IFE but I couldn't find the remote. Service for this airline was okay a smile from the flight attendants whenever they were serving us. The food is below average as I got a fish with rice meal for myself the fish was quite spicy which I did not like.,1
SYD-LAX. Staff didn't look properly trained but they were nice and funny! My food was excellent especially the desert! I had upgraded the day before and it was great! We got headsets more recline more legroom. A tidy and good looking cabin! Thanks a lot Virgin Australia!,1
ORD-CPH-HEL. The first sector was the late-night departure on one of SAS' ageing A340-300s. Seats rather uncomfortable but rather spacious. On-time departure and arrival. Staff service was rather unmemorable but I liked the touch of including a bottle of water in each seat pocket on departure. Dinner was fine breakfast was an inedible sandwich. But as there's no competition on this specific route SAS is the only way to go. CPH-HEL flight was uneventful very pleasant flight attendants clean cabin but buy-on-board food is expensive and not fresh. SAS didn't live up to expectations.,0
"Nice new aircraft. Quiet and clean but this airline discriminates based on your physical condition. This means that they sell you (for extra ) an ""XL Seat"" which is nothing more than the normal emergency exit seats. I tried to sit in a normal seat but I simply wouldn't fit (and I'm not that tall 194 cms). The friendly crew relocated me to the emergency exit row but what would I have done if the plane was full. Miss my flight? And why must I travel apart from my wife whom wasn't allowed to join me in the emergency exit row (which was mostly empty). At the airport when I inquired about booking the emergency exit row seats they tried to charge me ??0! And that's per seat! Needless to say I'll never fly with this airline again.",0
Big difference between Club and economy. Club does not cost much and it is really similar to premium economy on other airlines but it really is worth it. This was on an aged 310 from Manchester to Toronto. We could not get club on the outward leg but did for the return. Huge difference in comfort and attention: the upgrade was only some Â£97 each! I am 6'2 and was very uncomfortable on the back: very comfortable in the front given the extra baggage food drink and good service the upgrade is tremendous value.,1
Flew SilkAir from Singapore to Kathmandu and back. It was an A320 with very generous legroom in its economy class. The service was solid the meals were OK (although the meal out of Kathmandu was less good than the one out of Singapore) and although there is no in-seat IFE system time flew by quite quickly. Nothing extraordinary but good enough!,1
YVR-YYZ and YUL-YVR I had a great couple of flights and AC continue to improve their service. Breakfast in the Lounge was great in Vancouver as was lunch in the lounge in Montreal. The FA were a friendly crew and very attentive. In particular a woman serving us on our flight back to YVR was great. I appreciated the selection on the IFE and they made the 5 hour flight go by quickly. I fly AC regularly and the staff seem much happier these days. They even switched aircraft from a 320 to a 321 as they has so many passengers heading to Vancouver.,1
I flew 3 times aboard Bangkok Airways during a recent trip to Thailand. I was very impressed by the quality of its service. The service aboard is good staff professional and polite. They provide us with a really good meal even on 1-hour flights and they have a lounge at BKK Airport for the customers in transit which was very appreciated when we were waiting between our interconnecting flights via Chiang Mai. There we could enjoy a complimentary buffet coffee juices and Internet. It was very pleasant! Our flights were always on time.,1
MAD-DOH-DXB and back. Boeing 777 in MAD-DOH sectors was nice spacious 3-3-3 configuration and good legroom and IFE. Service and food was good but not outstanding as one expects from a 5-star airline. Boeing 787 in DOH-DXB sectors was amazing very modern and quiet airplane although seating would be a little bit tight for a long haul flight. The worst thing about Qatar Airways is Doha Airport it is very uncomfortable. It was crowded bathrooms were dirty and food options very limited. We had a very long bus ride from the terminal to the plane in the DOH- DXB flight. While boarding for the DOH-MAD flight we had to wait for half an hour for the bus to take us to the plane standing for that time in a crowded and small room at 2am is not a 5-star experience. I won't fly with them again until the opening of the new Doha Airport.,0
MXP-MUC-HND. First leg on time (not many snacks considering it was lunchtime). Second leg on an A340-600 plane full and upgraded to business. Good seat comfort and very good service from flight crew. IFE was good in both quality and choice. Despite a delay for tech issues before departure a very good travel experience.,1
London Gatwick - LAX 5th November LAX to London Gatwick 19th November. D7095 and D7096. I had a great trip with Norwegian their staff are friendly and attentive. It was my first time flying alone and they made me feel incredibly comfortable. The food and drinks are served promptly. The inflight entertainment is large and varied. The new Dreamliner 747 features lighting and air pressure control to help avoid strong jet lag. I would highly recommend.,1
DAR-CAI-CPH. Upgraded to lounge access in Dar. Aircraft's were new clean Boeing 737 2x3 rows configuration. Seafood meal was of high quality. FAs very attentive and efficient. IFE not of priority but worked though without options. Cheap ticket. All flights punctual.,1
LGW/OPO on 24 December returning 27th December. The fare was competitive check-ins fine the cabin crew smiled (on both legs of the trip) the flights were on time. Outcome: Excellent. What's not to like?,1
Jakarta-Shanghai-Jakarta. Airbus 330-200. First leg CGK-PVG in Business Class seat pitch is great service very attentive flight departed on time overall the hardware is excellent and on par with other leading airlines. As the flight left at midnight most passengers were asleep thanks to the lie flat seat able to get a good rest. Breakfast served approaching Shanghai. Return leg in Economy Class service is excellent despite the almost full flight. Very good selection of AVOD continuous drink service and a good lunch.,1
Beijing-Xi'an. We boarded on the tarmac then sat on the plane on the ground for 90 minutes due to air traffic congestion. Flight crew very friendly polite bowed during the announcements before and at the end of the trip. It is quite the treat to be served a meal on a domestic Chinese flight - a long dead practice here in North America! The breakfast meal was somewhat strange though : a vegetable porridge andsandwich. It was a nice flight the plane was a fairly new Boeing 737-800. It was my 1st time flying a domestic Chinese airline but an interesting experience at that.,1
Manchester - Cancun January 15th 2013. Flight approx 40 minutes late departing as had to de-frost wings. Newspapers available for everyone comfortable flight leg room adequate. Flight crew were attentive and informative. Meal quite nice including snack before landing. Ran out of red wine fairly quickly so many passengers would have been disappointed. Upgraded inflight entertainment and watched a couple of films to pass the time. Journey back on the 29th was a night flight similar to the day flight but the snack before landing was not as fresh. Pillow and blankets supplied.,1
"MSY to BOS on 6th July. I was initially confused and frustrated by the online check in process - they assign seats upon arrival at the gate, and you can only reserve online if you wish to pay for 'More Space' seats in advance. Both the phone and Twitter operatives were helpful when I raised this with them. We arrived at the gate with about an hour to spare, gate staff could not have been more helpful. We asked to have two seats together and were told that this would be resolved once the staff had logged in. 15 minutes later, we were called to the desk and found that we had been assigned to More Legroom at no extra cost. We were delighted with this and the seats were very comfortable. We also loved the DirectTv and Sirius Radio live streaming to the aircraft, a unique touch. The unlimited soft drinks and snacks were appreciated. The flight staff were attentive and approachable. The captain coming out to make the pre-flight briefing personally was a great touch. There was an on-ground delay of an hour due to bad weather in Washington, but the captain kept us fully informed of everything that was going on and since they had the foresight to switch the entertainment on prior to take-off (why doesn't every airline do that), we barely noticed. ",1
Delays delays. We were supposed to go from Maui to Kauai and be a 2 hr trip. It took 6 hours instead with us waiting in the airport for 4 hours. The people next to us had been waiting for 8 hours and got delayed another two as I started writing the review . Everyone has delays. Stay away from Island Air!,0
CZ3116 from Beijing to Guangzhou on March 18th. As I travel to China frequently I've flown with China Southern several times. In general the service is above average. Most flight attendants are young girls in their 20s. They look professional and respect customers. They were very polite to me though they barely understand English. Overall I am satisfied with the service.,1
Yesterday I flew from NYC to Israel. In the section I was sitting in there was something wrong with the speakers. Every 2-3 minutes for about a minute at a time the speakers would make a horrible screeching and buzzing sound for the duration of the flight - for 10 hours. The flight attendant tried to fix it eventually offered ear plugs. I have never seen so much chaos or got so little sleep. Due to the chaos they took longer than usual serving the meals and served the kosher special meals long before other meals. I will never fly El Al again!,0
Just returned Melbourne to London in Business class. Great staff service good food and comfortable seats (for angle lie flat). No alcohol may be problem for some people but did not worry us. Would definitely recommend. Not really a grip but a comment is that the range of movies on IFE was limited but at least the IFE worked without a hitch unlike many other airlines that I have been on.,1
SFO-IAD-SFO on November 2 and 4. Great service from the staff both on the ground and in the air. While there is food for purchase in the main cabin there is a good selection. The roast beef sandwich is really quite good.,1
"ORD to IAH. Check in was a bit of a hassle since the American Airlines staff directed us to a machine kiosk that was malfunctioning. After that hurdle was crossed a slew of others slowly came our way. Our original flight to IAH Houston was scheduled for 3.15pm at 2.55pm (local time) and arriving at 5.55pm the gate attendant told us that the flight had been delayed for an unspecified amount of time. We soon learned that the gate had been changed no announcement by telecom only by looking at the airport television screens did we figure this out. The new departure time was 3:34pm but that didn't happen either so the staff delayed the flight again to 4.04pm. As 4.15pm approached everyone was finally seated on this haggard and small CR7 jet. As we were about to leave the gate the pilot said there needed to be some maintenance and that it would take ""5 minutes"" to complete. 5 minutes passed and then 10 and then 20. By this time it was 4.25pm and we had yet to leave the gate. At 4.45pm we began taxing onto the runway when another problem arose. There apparently was an electrical failure and maintenance needed to be done once again. Back to the gate we go and by now its 5.10pm. Maintenance fixed the problem and off we go! We finally take off at 5.45pm.",0
Took 4 flights in Jan: SYD-EZE - no dramas other than ordinary food and lack of entertainment (a tiny central screen that is off color and barely able to hear the audio on my headphones) on a 15.5 hr flight. EZE-FTE - they changed the airport 8 hours before the flight (from EZE to AEP ) luckily I arrived early and they put me on a bus to the other airport. Delayed 30min. FTE-EZE - delayed 3 hours apparently because of storms in BA that morning but I had a 1630 flight and they never managed to catch up. EZE-SYD - delayed 16 hours initially for heavy rain in BA then they needed fresh crew then the new crew arrived late then missed curfew at Sydney airport. We waited at the airport and departure times kept getting pushed back. Missed my domestic connection but was able to rebooked the next day. At least the airport has free Wi-Fi. Staff do not care and were not helpful will never fly them again!,0
Went with Germanwings from Manchester to Cologne 21st October returned 28th October first time with this airline very satisfied and would definitely recommend to friends flights on time and staff very helpful.,1
MAN-ISN direct. Flight delayed 26 hours! After sitting at the airport for 6 hours we were taken to a hotel room. Six hours later they took us back to the airport and we had to spend the remaining hours at the airport. Served chips 3 times in 26 hours (this was them taking care of us). When we eventually took off there were no flight entertainment. It took them 1.5 hrs to serve food. 3 hours later somebody came to pick up the rubbish. Throughout they left the lights on (on a night flight). No air conditioning in the air and no leg room.,0
LHR-MCT-CMB-MCT-LHR on A333 and B738 excellent service on all flights with tasty meals and great entertainment system. Cabin Staff courteous and professional. Will definitely fly again.,1
"10 April 2015 Airbus A320 Business Heathrow to Rome FCO. A total waste of money. The food was ""tea"" there was no entertainment system and the only difference I could find from premium coach or regular coach was that the middle seat was empty and a portable table was placed between the arm rests. As alcoholic beverages are provided for all classes there's nothing to be gained there the seat pitch was pathetic and aside from having the middle seat empty the only benefit to be had was boarding and de-planing first. Don't waste your money unless someone else is paying for it.",0
"Flight 2674 from Ontario to San Jose was delayed about 40 minutes, lady behind counter claimed delay was due to mechanical problems, suggested to carry our luggage on so we can catch up with our connecting flight -flight 862- to Seattle. Unfortunately or maybe fortunately or it could have been planned that way, the flight to Seattle, was also delayed over one hour. Was told 20 people on the same plane boarded the plane heading to Seattle. ",0
NRT-ITM. B767. Taking profit of their Yens10000 offer for any Star alliance arriving passenger I booked a 5.55pn connecting flight to ITM. Fortunately my UA flight was on time immigration luggage delivery and customs very fast so NH kindly anticipated my flight to ITM for the 5.10pm one w/o fine. Lucky was I as a sudden fog invaded NRT delaying everyone. (I discovered arriving at ITM that my planned flight had been cancelled). Anyway we stayed 2 hours in the 767 constantly informed with free refreshments and apologies.,1
"I used to fly this airline and always said it was a great little airline. No more. My 2.5 hour trip from St. Pete to Rockford, IL took about 10 hours and two separate aircraft. First plane was brought back to the gate from the taxi way with ""mechanical issues"". After waiting another 5 hours for a second aircraft, the pilot aborted take off. Ground crews at both airports were very rude - that is if you could even find anyone with an Allegiant name tag, lol! As my final destination was Wisconsin, I chose Allegiant to Rockford to save on driving time once I had arrived. Never again. ",0
Flight out we all sat in the upstairs economy which is much better than downstairs. You feel less squashed in and you have extra room next to the window seat. Flight was to Las Vegas and they ran out of beer. I only wanted one towards the end of the flight but guess you had to get there quicker. Food was very average. Probably the poorest I've had on a long haul flight. Small portions and no little extra bits. Flight back we sat downstairs and was awful. My seat was broken and slipped of the edge every time I moved. We had no window. Again food was poor. No hot breakfast just a really hard cereal bar and a flat blueberry bun. Only alcohol available on this flight was spirits and red wine as they ran out of everything on the was to Las Vegas.,0
I fly BA business regularly between Delhi and London. I was surprised at how dirty the plane was - on 2 of my last three flights my table was sticky and the area around me stained. The food quality is generally pretty poor - especially on the Delhi to London leg. Also why not get some decent magazines - Country life Decanter the Economist rather than a dull inflight magazine and a grubby copy of Hello! I residually like BA but they have to up their game.,0
"Flying on A350 aircraft, I set a high expectation which wasn't fully met after all. The cabin is spotless and roomy. Each seat is equipped with touch screen, but unfortunately entertainment is not available on short-haul flights. Food was extremely basic and no coffee or tea was served, which is even worse than my trips with them few years ago. Cabin staff is decent and the plane arrived on time. Overall a little disappointed.",1
Flying Dubai to Penang via Singapore. Excellent service excellent food not too much expensive great flight entertainment selection. Flight from Singapore to Penang was operated by Silkair with an excellent service. Great airline overall. Definitely using this again.,1
We have flown eight segments with China Air over the last few years. The last flight was last week. Never on any flight have we left the gate on time. On the last segment Taipei to Bangkok. The steward said they had to shut down the video system. I was watching a movie. Around 45 minutes later I asked them to reboot the system or turn it on. They could not do it. Several stewards tried to no success. The food was served and the trays were left on the tray stand for about 45 minutes. So anyone wanting to go to the bathroom had a problem. They had bright lighting on well into the night. overall a poor flight. One seat we had was broken you could feel it in you back anytime you moved it would make a loud noise. Very inconvenient for us with all the late leaving flights and quick transfers. We tried this airline over United where we really felt the service and planes were very substandard. I really do not see much difference.,0
We travelled for 3 years on Allegiant from various locations in Montana and Sioux Falls as flights were a great deal and they were direct flights to LA. Last year the charges for carry on luggage were introduced and that was just about a deal breaker. Then when we had to exit from the back of the plane on the LAX landing strip after two hours in the plane due to another mechanical problem after having waited approx. 3 hours on our trip down the week earlier due to mechanical problems that was the last straw. We no longer felt safe on this airline the numerous mechanical delays you read on this website site attest to this. It was a good airline once. It was a good value once. No more.,0
Club Europe from LHR to Frankfurt RTN. Outbound flight was great A320 with new seats which are very comfortable great food and a good service. Aircraft on the return leg was a very old A319 rather dirty and quite shabby looking inside however purser working Club Europe was outstanding.,1
Perth - Gatwick Jan 17 returning Feb 11 business class. This is a quality service with really good times and connections. The seat to and from Perth-Jakarta is a basic business recliner on the 737. We thought the connection in Jakarta would be tight but it was all fine with no rush or hassle apart from the rude Dutch businessmen going home. The cabin staff handled them well. The 777 ER from Jakarta leaves at 01.00 for a 13-14 hour trip to Schiphol. The cabin setup is excellent with solo window seats alternate couples together in the middle or two seats separated. We were together in the middle. The seats mattresses and bedding were as good as Qatar on the same routes - really comfortable but without the pyjamas. The full flat bed was a bit like the Qatar 787 layout and might be a bit tight for anyone over 180cm. Food and drink is good but anyone with any brain is not flying business for this. Equally the lounges are basic at both Gatwick and Jakarta but very acceptable. Business class is about being able to sleep in a comfortable flat bed. They excel. The connections on the way back are also excellent with a close connection in Jakarta and arrival in Perth at 1930. Garuda have certainly set a new standard for this route. Highly recommended.,1
Just returned from Murcia in Spain for a two week holiday in August 2014. At last a joy to travel with a budget airline who puts the customer first. No queues at check in via East Midland and Murcia also you are greeted with a check in clerk who is not a robot and puts the customer first. Jet2 have moved forward on looking after their customer and much better than the other budget airlines.,1
"ORD-MSY, 1st July. Online check-in was swift and simple, no delays and friendly ground and air crew. Basic plane so no wifi or IFE but it was only a 1.5 hour flight so can't really complain. A bit of a bumpy landing in the rain but very well-handled by captain and crew. Was served a complimentary drink but no food, but again only a 1.5 hour flight. Would happily recommend AA to others.",1
March 20 2014. I paid $491 rt from LAX to Fort Lauderdale plus a $100 for my tiny carry on plus $32 for the seats - total $629. I have never flown this airline before and never will again! Horrible customer service cramped seats no radio or TV smelly and the dirtiest bathrooms I have used! I will never recommend or fly this airline!,0
MAN-DOH-BOM return 24th Oct. Standards have dropped compared to previous experiences out of 4 legs only on 2 legs reserved seats with infant were honoured. Staff attitude in air as well as on ground not very friendly.,0
Living in Canada one must either fly with Air Canada or West Jet domestically and have to use one of them for the first part of any international flight. Air Canada never fails to disappoint with their service it is dismal to say the least. They charge for everything from earphones to food on domestic flights. Food on international flights is also poor. I recently had breakfast on Thai Airways Singapore Airways and Air Canada. The meal was almost identical in all three instances but the portion size and taste was significantly better on Thai and Singapore. The dinner meals on Air Canada were also less than impressive compared to the Thai and Singapore. On more than 1 occasion my personal TV didn't work properly and flights nearly always depart late. I have flown nearly all types of Air Canada aircraft (787 777 767 A321 (A320) A330) and while their larger aircraft are comfortable their older smaller aircraft are uncomfortable. In the event there is a problem and you need to contact someone be prepared to be put on hold for at least 1 hour. The last few times I have called 60 minutes was the quickest I was able speak to a human.,0
Flew QF652 Sunday 8th. My wife choose to use her maiden name so I always ring to ensure they put us together. Told by phone service that they could not allocate seats so I would need to do it at airport. Told at airport that flight was full and best they could do is me at 34b and my wife at 54j. She said how sorry she was but I could try at lounge. This company has a bad attitude when if comes to customer service.,0
Jeddah - Abha - Jeddah. Regular flyer with SV. Jeddah airport chaotic. Will be glad when the new airport is built - eventually. Flight was during Ramadam but cabin crew were happy to offer refreshments to non-Muslims. Don't bother with pre-arranged seating. Cabin crew will move passengers so that families can sit together. Cabin crew looked resigned to their jobs. People on their phones during the flight seats not upright as instructed. Overall poor safety within the cabin. An elderly lady was sitting in the exit row with bags on the floor and the cabin crew walked past. Honestly they get you from A to B without the seriousness of western airlines.,1
My favorite airline JetBlue was impossibly expensive for one way from Ft Myers FL to Boston so I didn't have much of a choice except to give them a try. I booked online adding $35 for carry on and $14 for seat selection of an aisle seat and still came in under $200 - way below any others for a non-stop late reservation. I printed out my boarding pass before leaving home. I carried on a sandwich and drink. The aircraft Airbus 320 with 3-3 seating seemed brand new. Everything was spotless and unscratched. The seats were tight and close but not any more so than AirTran. Half way through the flight I realized the seats didn't recline but it was just a 3 hour flight so endurable. The boarding process was painless; it was a full flight and we left on time and arrived early. I didn't get out of my seat so can't comment on the bathroom facilities. Also I had to answer all the questions but I had no experience with staff service food and beverages and inflight entertainment so only rated them 1 star which might affect my overall rating. I recommend Spirit with the caveat that it definitely is no frills and would fly them again if price and a non-stop flight are my only concerns.,1
Kept waiting for more then one hour in the plane to pick up some late comers. I am a frequent traveller from abroad and was on Goa - Ahmedabad flight on 27th February. It was 3.25pm but took off after 4.30. The onboard crew or flight deck crew were not bothered about other passengers. The passengers we waited for had booked 150 seats. I was sitting right in the front seat in row 1 so could hear what was said. There was no apology from the crew or cabin staff. When we landed at Ahmedabad airport we reported to the ground staff. We were asked to complain to the customer service knowing there will be no outcome. It was first time I had travelled Indigo who boast of their punctuality. Never again.,0
Stockholm to Doha and Doha to Hong Kong and then returned the same way. During all of my flights the inflight entertainment system did not work properly for my seat and when it finally worked the screen was so scratched that it was hard to see anything. The seats were comfortable because the flight was almost empty yet the food could be classed only as average. When wanting to change the date of my return flight I was not helped at all on the phone nor through email/ website and when I actually went physically to their office in HK I was refused a change despite me wanting to pay for the difference. I cannot recommend them due to the service issues.,0
We should have flown on ZB1529 from Enfidha to Gatwick at 19.25 on 24 Sept. We finally flew from Tunis at 02.30 the next day. We were not given any information no food or drink. Feel totally let down by the airline and no customer service as we were finally moved in busses in the dead of night.,0
"Goa to Bombay. Flight delayed an hour ""due to runway issues"" in Goa. Ground staff very helpful and accommodating and blocked out 2 adjacent seats for us at the front of the aircraft. Aircraft (A320) was clean crew were efficient although a little harried with the buy-on-board meal service given the short flight time. Good value for money and would fly them again.",1
Food wasn't the best I've had but it was edible. Plane was very cold on all flights - the stopovers were very annoying waiting around and everybody trying to get off the plane at once. Cabin crew friendly and attentive although I didn't liked getting woken up on my way from Brunei to Hong Kong asking if I wanted some food.,1
I flew last night on LAN's 787 Dreamliner - SCL-JFK (LA0532) and can only say that the aircraft is impressive. Business Class is comfortable and very well designed. Service was very professional and extremely warm. The departure was delayed by over 1.5 hrs and the not very informed not very courteous LAN employees at the gate made the wait experience quite uncomfortable. The crew could have not being nicer and more professional to help passengers find comfort and a chilled glass of champagne or a refreshing glass of water. The service once airborne was excellent and the food very good. I was in seat 1H which is inconveniently located at the entrance to the service area and at no time was I disturbed. This was my best long-haul flight in a very long time.,1
"Flew internationally from Costa Rica in hopes to arrive in Dallas. When we arrived in fort Lauderdale, we were in the process of customs for over 1.5 hours causing us to be late to the connecting flight. Even though the airplane was still there and finishing prep work for the flight, they would not let us on the plane because ""the doors are already closed"". We asked about a different flight and were told that there was no other flight to leave that day. That was incorrect because there was another flight to leave 20 minutes after ours to dallas that we may have been able to get on. After sitting at the ticket counter for over 1 hour, we were told by a ""supervisor"" that there was nothing we could do and we would need to wait till the next day. We were lucky enough to rebook with Southwest airlines (who had a 2 minute ticket counter wait). I will never fly Spirit again!",0
Flew Manchester-Abu Dhabi-Singapore-Brisbane in December 2013 and now Brisbane-Singapore-Abu Dhabi-Brussels and on both legs all flights were great. Very nice and friendly personnel great good with good choices good entertainment system colouring packs and games for the children everything was great. Would definitely recommend them and fly with them again.,1
My wife and I arrived two hours early to check in. Just before boarding time we were informed the flight was late. The flight was delayed three hours in good weather. After boarding and waiting to take off we accelerated down the run way and came to a screeching halt. The plane was not fit to fly and we were returned to the terminal. At this point it was mass confusion people were standing in lines with no instruction or guidance. We finally managed to get our luggage back but unable to contact Allegiant about anything else.,0
Travelled from Madrid to Buenos Aires in May as the starting point of my South-American holidays. Reasonable prices and a remarkably good service all along the flight. There was a wide range of food to choose including delightful Argentinean beef. Check-in was fast and simple and the flight had no delays at all.,1
KUL-BAH-CDG return on the 330 for all segments. Excellent value for money! FA's professional friendly and hospitable. The food was appetizing with a wide variety of options. What remains for Gulf Air is simply to replace their aircraft's with new ones and their rating will definitely improve.,1
Marrakech to LHR via Casablanca. Check in smooth and friendly travelled onwards to Oslo on SAS. Baggage checked thru on request. Departed on time pleasant travel on new 737-800. Good service food ok and drinks included.,1
Flew from Bellingham to Las Vegas on November 17th 2014. My first and last Allegiant trip. 6 hour delay in Bellingham arriving in Vegas after midnight and losing our first evening on a short break. They gave us a $8 meal voucher which bought half a burger at the only restaurant in Bellingham air side. What looked like a cheap fare was not so good after adding $30 to select a seat $26 to take a carry on bag and another $26 for a carrier usage fee. When the plane did finally take off it was freezing cold they charge for everything on board and didn't even have hot drinks available. Consumer loyalty needs to be earned from delivering service above and beyond customers expectations.,0
"I paid USD 610 for a return flight CPH-VNO in Economy Class. The flying time is 80 minutes on a CRJ900 with cramped seating. Nothing but coffee/tea was served. Excuse me but for 610 dollars return that is just not good enough. SAS crew might be good but inflight service on this airline is frankly a lot worse than the ""low-cost"" airlines I know of.",0
Booked a trip to Cancun from Toronto and was surprised to arrive on board and see the business class cabin had been replaced by some awful seats. You no longer get the business class you paid for just a regular economy seat with nobody in the middle. Food and beverages were the same but completely lacking in seat comfort complete bait and switch by Air Canada on this one should have received a refund. Only good thing was I had two tray tables to play with. No IFE either and the streaming they offered the newest movie I could find was Cliffhanger! Truly pathetic.,0
LHR to Istanbul - excellent service on the outbound flight on what was a very busy flight. Cabin crew worked very hard and consistently. Good management on the ground and for boarding excellent cabin crew. T5 lounge ok but breakfast food soon ran out and rather slow in service.,1
Flown AMM-KUL-AMM on the brand new 787-8. Excellent services started right from the Crown Class dedicated check-in area where they took care of my arrangements away from the airport rush then I went directly to the luxury of the crown lounge where you can enjoy a snack and a beverage in complete comfort and satisfaction then to the priority boarding (where I could be the last to board since I'm a J-Class pax) then the flight attendant wearing the traditional Jordanian robe welcomed and greeted me warmly from my first step she directed me to my fully flat bed seat equipped with state of the art IFE System and offered me a soft drink as well she granted Aigner amenity kit that contains what anyone could really need during the flight she offered headphones to start enjoying the modern intuitive IFE System shortly after take off Crown dining begins with tasty gourmet dishes of my own selection and preference then I was served a hot towel before I went to sleep I refreshed in the clean lavatory then I woke up for a healthy tasty breakfast before landing in BKK then after landing in BKK a new fresh crew joined to continue the flight directly to KUL in flight from BKK-KUL you have another full meal after landing On-time in KUL Crown Class Passengers leave the aircraft before opening the curtains of Economy Class to avoid rush. Excellent Services RJ.,1
Am thoroughly fed up with Flybe customer services. My wife and I checked into the Flybe desk at Faro on the 29th September for the return trip to Exeter. Despite the fact that we had pre-booked our seats paying the New Economy Flight tariff we were told the aircraft was too full to allow us to sit together. I complained to Flybe customer services yet I have not even received the courtesy of an acknowledgement. Both outbound and inbound flights were also an hour late on departure.,0
Sao Paulo - Buenos Aires business cabin. great flight to Aeroparque. Boarding with priority. Once on board great crew very interactive and provided very good service. Departure on time hot lunch served very good menu. Good selections of wine. Seat comfortable for a A320. Arrival on time no Passport lines in Aeroparque which is in the city center of Buenos Aires.,1
"Toronto to Peurto Plata return. Pleasantly surprised by the ""welcome"" sparkling wine then dinner accompanied by wine. The food was excellent and flight attendants friendly and attentive on both flights.",1
9/13/2013 Flights: 231 Nashville to Denver 551 Denver to San Diego 563 Denver to San Diego. Travelers beware. Frontier is no longer what it once was. The ticket gate and customer service agents will - either through incompetence or deliberate false manipulation - frustrate your efforts to smooth out the hiccups caused by their poor schedule management. Flight delays and missed connections are tough luck - takes 12 hours to travel Nashville to San Diego or Chicago to Las Vegas or Austin to Denver. There were 100s of these stories just in one day. The staff denied that connections would be missed (they were) claimed all flights were delayed (they weren't) claimed later flights were full (not true). New militant carry on baggage measurements and charges don't ask for water coffee or a soda unless you have your credit card handy and don't count on them having anything edible on board. If you still decide to travel with this miserable airline the best of luck.,0
"One-way economy Coolangatta-Taipei (via 8 hour layover Singapore). Departure and arrival on schedule. Paid extra for a ""yellow"" seat with more leg room; 5+ kg luggage; and ScootThru. Later decided to upgrade to ScootBiz but the website does not allow for upgrading. Check-in very crowded slow and understaffed. Avoided the crowd by going to the ScootBiz counter and upgrading but could only upgrade to Singapore. I had to upgrade Singapore- Taipei at Changi. ScootBiz is not luxurious. Seat is a little wider and with a power outlet. Metal foot rest is uncomfortable. Meal was a sandwich and a small can of Pringles plus a drink. Flight crew were young energetic all very nice and well groomed. The pilot and crews English pronunciation were mostly incomprehensible. Entertainment package - you login using a special PIN. There are no instructions on how to set up your computer. No one from Scoot will help you. Upon arrival in Singapore I went to the Transfer counter in Lounge E Terminal 2 to get my new boarding pass. Transfer desk had 2 people working I waited 45 minutes. At Changi Airport I had gone to the Widevine Media Optimizer website and downloaded the entertainment browser add-on after which it installed without a problem. The entertainment system then worked from Singapore to Taipei. All-in-all if you are looking for a reliable and cheap no frills airline Scoot is okay. Every extra will cost you some money.",1
"BOI-SNA round trip. Took my 4 year old son. We had no problems whatsoever on our flights. Connected in Las Vegas heading to SNA then Phoenix heading back to Boise. Flight from SNA to PHX was overbooked but since I was travelling with a 4 year old we got on right after the ""A"" group. I thought the boarding process was odd and I prefer assigned seating but I saved so much money on the lack of baggage fees it was worth it to me. Seats were more comfortable and I had more legroom than on other airlines I've flown. I'd fly SWA again for sure.",1
Mykonos to Rome and no complaints at all. The bag drop at Mykonos airport was swift boarding was easy and it was a very comfortable flight.,1
Santiago to Sao Paulo on TAM business and I found the service standard very poor. Boarding at the gate was chaotic and business and first class passengers were kept waiting at the gate for more than 30 mins. Business class staff seemed uninterested no after take off drinks offered. The first drink we received was with our lunch which was delivered on one single tray. I found the service standard of the this flight below other companies' business class services and a little smile from the crew will go a long way. The business class seats (this was a Boeing 777 aircraft) were uncomfortable and with a need for new covers - they look worn out. I would not recommend the airline for international flights.,0
SIN-HKG-SIN. Check in at both airports were fast and efficient. The planes on both legs were the Boeing 777-200. The IFE on the plane is in serious need of upgrading. Watching movie was a struggle as the screen resolution is very low. Furthermore it can only be used after the plane took off and before it landed. This is in contrast to some Middle Eastern airlines where the IFE can be used right after stepping in to and before getting off the plane. The cabin crews were polite especially the one on the return leg. She was very helpful and full of smile. The special foods that I requested were available on both leg and tasted ok.,1
Worst flight I have been on. My husband and I flew Business class from Abu Dhabi to London Heathrow in pre-booked seats. A mother and child of 4 had been allocated seats apart which is appalling and we were asked by cabin crew if we would change seats with them just for take off as the little boy was upset. Deceitful cabin crew wouldn't let us return to our seats and we had to sit apart for the whole journey. Dishonest and conniving complained to Etihad they don't want to know.,0
Flew VIE to LHR Club Europe fantastic crew looking after the Club Europe cabin the only let down is the new revamped Club Europe Cabin. I really do not believe what BA is saying that this is what their European Passengers want! The seat pitch has now been reduced from 34 inches to 30 inches which used to be the Charter Airlines seat pitch years ago. If the passenger in front reclines their seat it is impossible to work on your laptop as there is no room. I really am not able to justify paying the Club Europe Fare for an economy class seat which is the most uncomfortable seat I have ever say in. A number of passengers were not impressed with the new cabin and all felt badly let down by BA. British Airways used to be a class above the rest now they are just an average low cost carrier but still charge the high fares BA really need to think seriously about the Club Europe layout they have added more seats so it is all about money & not about what their passengers really want.,0
Overbooked flights planes grounded for maintenance issues replacement aircraft with fewer seats. My flight out of Houston quickly fell apart as the original plane was both over-booked and grounded for maintenance issues. While waiting to find out if there were enough seats for everyone stragglers who had been bumped off previous flights were given seats over those who were actually assigned to the flight. Overall a very poorly executed attempt at damage control.,0
"Heathrow to LA in Economy. This was my first and last time flying with Air NZ. Firstly the best aspect was the crew friendliness. They seem good fun and genuinely happy to help. The ones I chatted to really hate the 777-300 aircraft. One said it wasn't designed to 4 seats in middle row and she seemed genuinely sorry for the customers squashed in a middle seat. A result of having an extra seat in the middle has meant that the aisles have got narrower. I really felt sorry for the crew having to walk sideways a lot of the time. I was in an aisle seat and was constantly being bashed by the crew and passengers waking past. Clearly they are trying to squeeze out as much profit at the expense of customer comfort. I paid extra for a ""preferred seat"" and apparently this includes a row behind a leg room seat. Not sure why I had to pay extra for this seat that was no different to any other regular row. When the guy in front put his seat back I felt so claustrophobic and could hardly see my TV screen. The food was very average and I waited over 80 minutes to be served an alcoholic drink with my meal. Being offered a glass of tap water just after take-off is very poor and not what you'd expect from a very expensive ""4 star airline."" The choice of films is very limited and very few new titles. I'll most certainly be flying on BA A380 next time I go to LA.",0
Manchester-Keflavik and return. It has been many years since we last flew with easyJet and all we can say how much they have improved. Our flight from MAN commenced with a lovely smile from the girl on check in which did not take long. Flight on time on outbound. Meals on the aircraft were very good and not too expensive. Aircraft very clean cabin crew excellent and professional both flights. Inbound flight departed 30 mins late from KEF due to taxi ways requiring clearing of snow! Arrived 10 mins late into MAN. Will definitely use them again on this route.,1
We flew from Toronto to Cancun the last week of January and dreaded the return the next week. We booked Air Canada because the flight times were good we collect Aeroplan and fly AC from Toronto to Calgary at least once a year. We did not know anything about Rouge and not until almost the time for our flight did we know AC had another section for hot spots. We were not concerned because we have always been happy with our service. We did not know there was no in-flight entertainment until we were on the plane. We do not use Apple products but have an Android tablet no good to us on the flight. The seats are squishy and uncomfortable. The only saving grace coming home was I had booked late flights so we just slept no other choice. When we got to our destination I went on the web to learn about Rouge. It is not easy to find anything. Next time we will go to the States and choose an American carrier. Never again Rouge.,0
We booked and paid for a package in May 2013 to fly to Munich in Dec 2013. Flight out was with Lufthansa which was great. However when we tried to check in online the day before our return to Cyprus with Aegean through Athens we got an error message saying 'non valid ticket' and giving us a number to call. We called the number which was Lufthansa and the agent told us he could see our booking but couldn't check us in as the computer systems weren't compatible. We tried the Aegean online check in but still no joy. So we got to Munich airport 2.5 hours before our flight to check in only to be told we were on standby! We were assured that the gate personnel would sort it out to our satisfaction so we went through to the departure gates. The departure gate had changed but not updated on the terminal screen. When we finally found it the staff were very off hand about us being on standby even though we couldn't understand how we didn't have a seat when the whole thing had been booked and paid for 7 months earlier. After making a big fuss and having to wait until 5 mins before take off we finally managed to get on the plane but not seated together. Another passenger offered to swap seats so we did sit together in the end. Unfortunately we were supposed to transfer in Athens and were very concerned that we would have to go through the whole thing again and we actually refused to board the Athens plane until we were sure we had seats on the Athens to Cyprus plane. No acceptable explanation was given as to why we had been given the run-around and in fact we were made to feel that we were just making a fuss about nothing. The service on board was indifferent food was shoddy and we will never fly with Aegean again. We've flown a lot long and short haul and I can safely say this was the worst experience ever.,0
"Flew back from Milan LIN on Jan 4th. Because of ""mist"" (the pilot's actual characterization) most flights that morning had been delayed/canceled in/out of LHR. No delay info given at check-in nor at gate. Upon boarding the captain informed us that because of ""mist"" we were being held on the ground for 2 hours. My connecting flight to SFO was 2.5 hrs after landing in LHR. Flight attendant assured me most flights were being delayed therefore mine to SFO most likely too. Upon landing in LHR a sea of canceled/delayed lost souls. I was immediately told I was forced to miss my connection because my flight to SFO was on time. I was forced to join the longest line I've ever seen for rebooking. It never moved. We were told another set of rebooking desks were available upstairs ""and faster"". Crossing the border control took just as long. Upstairs it took me 5 hours just to get closer to the desks but still at least a couple hours away. I finally managed to join the free wifi and call BA's office to get rebooked online. I was rebooked on a flight from SFO to LHR. The wrong way around. When I pointed out the obvious the agent told me there was a ""computer glitch"" and promised to call me back. She finally called me back and got rebooked on AA flights to JFK and to SFO from there. The next morning at the AA check in they could not check me in on the JFK-SFO because of ""issues with the BA ticket"". It took 90 minutes and multiple interactions with 3 different desks to get it solved. I nearly missed the flight to JFK too. My suitcase was never loaded on that flight and I didn't get it at JFK. It took me 5 days to get my suitcase back. I will never fly British Airways again.",0
Flew Frankfurt Hahn to Plovdiv and returned a couple of days later. The flights were on time and the planes were reasonably clean. We travelled with hand baggage only and didn't pay extra for seat allocation. We travel regularly with Ryanair and rarely experience problems - I find them more reliable than many other airlines. The return flight was 2 1/2 hours and I think that this is the limit that I'd be prepared to fly with Ryanair. After two hours you do start to notice the hardness of the seat and lack of leg room but for short flights they're good.,1
Booked my flight to Phoenix with the aircraft showing as a 320 only to discover when I received an itinerary change notification the equipment would be a rouge 319. My first flight with Rouge what a dreadful experience - old aircraft no leg room even if you 'rent' an ipad the entertainment options are dismal and no discount in the price. Having been a loyal supporter of Air Canada for many years with Super Elite/Elite status and having flown over 1-million miles I was extremely disappointed with the 'standard' that Air Canada is now offering under this brand for future travel I will certainly we looking for other options when travelling to any destinations being serviced by Air Canada rouge.,0
I used Qatar for the first time in January 2013 from LHR-DOH-DAC-DOH-LHR. Everything went smoothly and I have booked again with them for my 2014 holiday.,1
Excellent service at business class desk in Colombo lounge too busy. But ok. On board excellent service better than many 1st class services. Excellent food and attention to service the inflight entertainment was poor but it is on British Airways. The wash bag was excellent but on arrival at London nobody knew about the car service which was booked. Excellent flat beds on board.,1
Bujumbura-Kigali-Bujumbura Dash 8-100. Both flights on time safety and organisation appear to be high. Good service onboard despite flight duration is only 40 minutes: snacks 4 different juices sodas. Good information on board and luggage delivered in 5 minutes upon passing immigration.,1
"4 flight sectors altogether: SIN-DOH-LHR on 5 May CDG-DOH-SIN on 21/22 May. SIN-DOH-SIN were on 787 DOH-LHR and CDG-DOH were on A380. A journey of contrasts between the excellent A380 and nightmare 787 which led to an average rating. For all 4 flights the in-flight entertainment were new advanced and top-notch though slightly laggy. USB ports were available for charging of equipment. The food was decent though the main meal servings were small. For snacks what they called sandwiches were actually (very oily) wraps with a small slice of cake. Service was also average (not as friendly as I'd expect though I must pity them because they sometimes had to deal with a tough crowd of fliers) and can be inconsistent across flights and even within a flight. For instance different kinds of snacks served sometimes a paper menu is used while other times it isn't. That said I appreciate the free amenity kit for the red-eye flights. The booking website was also a pain to use sometimes with outdated information or links that failed to work. New Doha airport which serves as QR's hub - looks new but unfortunately isn't customer-oriented. Now to the specific flight sectors / planes. The A380 is newer and very spacious with comfortable seat pitch and seat width. I will definitely fly their A380 again. The 787 ""Dreamliner however belies its ""dream"" qualities: I did not feel the narrower seat width until I had a man next to me poke his elbows into my ribs for hours while using a laptop on the DOH-SIN leg. I never felt this uncomfortable on a long-haul flight before. For the DOH-LHR leg I was ""upgraded"" to upper deck economy class due to a full flight and as I was a (rival) BA Avios member. Such seats are unavailable for normal reservation except for QR FFP members. That said I was a little unhappy with being ""upgraded"" to a seat without a window which I had originally reserved and requested. Overall I might fly QR again if the price and timing is right for in general they have performed above-average. Potential deterrent factors would include their 787 their buggy website and Doha airport (woe betide anyone with a long layover).",1
"Lyon to Oran. Two Airbus A320 are mainly dedicated for operations between Lyon ad Algeria. I would allow that the service tends to decrease. I can't stand how Aigle Azur operates ""charter planes with high density configuration for regular flights between France and Algeria. It is unbearable to get sat so tight in those seating rows impossible to move or eat correctly.",0
13/6/14 EK71 DXB-CDG. Boarding very orderly by zones. Sparkling new aircraft of 0.6 years old. Full flight. IFE as usual very good with ICE being top notch. Too many things to watch and do. There's even a customer service survey under the C component. I didn't like that there were no drink runs done after take off not even a tray of drinks like what SQ and CX does. Snack service 1h after take off and drinks another 30m later. Snack consisted of a roasted chicken sandwich and chocolate chip pecan cookies. Breakfast was really good with choices between omelette with creamed spinach and scrambled eggs with hash browns. I had the former. Omelette didn't taste like airplane stuff creamed spinach really good. Fruits were fresh too. I like that they provide croissants in addition to normal bread made me feel like I'm in France already. Drinks service was really generous and there was no limit on the number of drinks both alcoholic and non alcoholic that you could take. Even during breakfast drink service you could ask for alcohol and no questions asked. Staff service was really good on this flight the best flight out of the 4 legs I flew with them. Smiles during service call buttons answered promptly and drink trays brought around after meal service for people who turn thirsty quickly like myself. I went to the galley to ask for my bottle to be refilled and they even asked me to sit down and they'll return the bottle to me. I asked for 3 boxes of playing cards as souvenir and they obliged as well with a smile. Excellent service beats SQ on this leg. EK is really good if you get an awesome crew like this.,1
Flew Chennai - Dubai and back. Both flights took off and landed on time clean interiors and great in-flight crew. A wide selection of movies and other programs on the in-flight entertainment system. The quality of food served was also good and no one was refused an extra drink. Overall a very good experience.,1
Sydney to Shanghai and on to New Delhi. Sydney-Shanghai flight was surprisingly great after reading some of the reviews. I requested and had an exit seat requested vegetarian meals and it arrived on all sectors without any issues. The seats were comfortable and even offered power outlets for laptops in economy seats! Movie selection was limited. Shanghai - Delhi sector had older planes and no power in the seats and we managed to get exit row seats again and food as ordered. Drinks menu was limited to Chinese beer and french red wines - which was OK.,1
LAX to TLV recently and the worst flight I've ever been on. Bad leg room terrible food and an elderly lady next to me trying to take over half my seat I've come to expect nothing more from most flights. What I do care about is the careless way they treated my luggage. All of my luggage except for my violin were messed up (and I mean messed up) when I got them back.,0
Flew MAN-FRA-BOG round trip last week. Overall was I was impressed with Lufthansa and would fly with them again. IFE is good if a little dated. FA's are very professional courteous and friendly. They were helpful with every request that I or other pax around me had. The aircraft (B737 A346 and A320) were clean. I opted for the vegetarian meals and was impressed with taste and quality. My only gripe is the seat pitch in economy. Thankfully I had a spare seat next to me on FRA-BOG outbound otherwise it does feel a bit cramped for a 180cm person like myself. I would travel with Lufthansa again.,1
Manchester UK - Munich - Singapore - Brisbane and same for return. Very friendly crew very welcoming and helpful. Hot towels before take off nice food and a good range of snacks available at any time. Good range of TV programmes and films that keep you entertained. Blankets socks and headphones provided on each flight. Seats not particularly big with only slightly more leg room than a short haul flight but still fairly comfortable. Always on time with no problems/delays. Overall a great airline with a great service! Would definitely recommend.,1
September 6 2013 Business Class from Frankfurt to Santiago via Sao Paulo. Airplane 777 fairly new. FA's make you feel they were doing you a favor bringing you food. Very cold service attitude and sometimes rude. They expected everyone to speak Portuguese. Plane in this section had 3 bathroom one was kept locked only for FA's to use. They did not care there was a line and still kept the bathroom closed. Food was ok nothing special. Inflight entertainment had a poor selection of films. Chaotic boarding in SAO.,0
"HEL-AMS-HEL. A very friendly crew light modern A321 for my size and for a short flight there was enough space a ""tandoori"" chicken sandwich was tasty coffee tea water and soft drinks free. Why so low rating? With the Finnair's ticket prices selling daily newspapers is an embarrassment to the company the crew and the passenger. Secondly and more importantly: the baggage drop took 45 minutes! I almost missed the flight and queuing through the entire terminal building (and in the corridor to next one) was a nuisance!",0
We flew from Halifax to St Petersburg Florida return this year. I was extremely nervous to fly this airline when I read some of the reviews but I have to say our experience was fine. The staff were friendly (for the most part). The bistro meals were a little disappointing. We were about 1/2 hour late going south and about 1 hr late heading home. No big deal. We were over weight and had to pay an extra $30 for the 3 kgs we were over. My only complaint is that for flights to somewhere other than an all inclusive the weight should be increased. Overall the experience with Sunwing was positive.,1
Luton to Budapest. On the way out all was fine apart from the smallest legroom I have ever encountered on a plane. However on the return leg things were different. All seemed to be going very well they started checking us in an hour before the departure time and we went down to the busses for boarding (or so we thought). However we were crammed into the bendy bus. We were crammed in like sardines with small children and parents all mixed in. It was dark and cold outside and they kept us cooped up in there for over 30 mins. Away we went without a hint of explanation let alone an apology. I can only assume the way Wizzair have got round their debacle with the airport is to use their busses as waiting areas prior to boarding. It was a shame really because the other parts of the flight were perfectly acceptable and the cabin crew fine.,1
SIN-BWN in 2013. B787 was clean and ambience was great. The cabin crew were friendly. Being a Muslim I find the travel prayer was aired through the IFE did reduce my nervousness. IFE sufficient for the short flight. I don't recall what was served for the inflight meal but it was tasty. Toilets in B787 clean and modern. BWN-SIN flight back to Singapore was nearly full so security check arduously slow as the queue was long. Flight back also on B787. Cabin crew was helpful and we were greeted with smiles. Overall my flights with RBA were satisfying and I hope they keep improving and be able to compete with major airlines.,1
LAX-MEL in April 2011 in Economy. Great experience - seats were wide and comfortable (firm yes but they are designed this way and it works); in flight entertainment is more than adequate (and its your own screen unlike United); the 777 was clean and obviously new. Was in the very last row with an aisle seat which is great because you have extra space to your side. Returned MEL to LAX in April 2012. Unlike in LA the check-in process at MEL was rushed and the customer service agent I worked with was well below average. She had to reprint me baggage tags because she never asked what my final destination was and grumbled when asked to do so. Otherwise another good flight with excellent customer service (one flight attendant was downright rude but this was outweighed by others who were pleasant professional and attentive). The really great thing about V Australia though is that they have less restrictive and cheaper rules for flight changes than Qantas does even if you book with the cheapest possible sale fares.,1
I did nine flights with Lan as part of an extensive South American package and found them to be very good. They were far superior to Qantas. While selling as a LAN business class package there are actually no business seats for flying within Argentina or Chile so business is only for the International component. Flight attendants generally did their job very well and were friendly. The pisco sours from Lan were the nicest I had and food was always of good quality. The problem and this is a big one is with the scheduling. LAN schedules daily flights Santiago to Auckland but seem to cancel them quite easily. Our flight on the 21st March was cancelled and I believe a second flight was also cancelled that week. Obviously this causes major inconvenience and although we had plenty of notice we still had nothing else to do but spend time in the Santiago Airport holiday Inn. Some of the Argentine regional airports could have used a third check-in counter going (El Calafate Ushuaia) as there were long queues. A large tour group was allowed to effectively push in front of us at one of these airports which I wasn't happy with.,1
Trondheim-Oslo-Stockholm-Helsinki then Lulea-Stockholm-London Heathrow. A lot of flights but the price was right and very I thought very reasonable and cheap as long as you book well ahead. My flight from Trondheim to Oslo was cancelled (1st leg of my Helsinki flight) but they did thankfully get me to Helsinki on 3 separate flights the same night and I arrived at 12.30am but worked for me. The airline staff were nice and friendly very un-eventful trips and tea and coffee was free - that was all. The airline is now a budget airline and has lost that wow factor. As the price was a bargain I booked but BA would of been my preferred airline as at least you still get food and drink for free! But as I was flying into such expensive airports like Heathrow Stockholm Helsinki and Oslo this was my only option.,0
Returned from Florence to Gatwick yesterday. Flight delayed by 2 hours due to: Adverse weather conditions forcing switch to shorter runway resulting in 20 passengers being identified who had to move to next door boarding desk to be told they would not be flying that night as weight had to be reduced on plane to allow safe take off on the shorter runway. Luggage for those passengers had to be removed before we could fly and those selected included a split in couples and groups of friends leaving one husband flying but his wife not! We arrived in Gatwick and waited 2 hours in luggage reclaim before having to use passenger power to get information about our luggage. It was only then we were informed by ground staff (not Vueling) that our luggage was never onboard! It appears Vueling outsource luggage logistics to Swissport who have a reputation for being totally inefficient with Customers at Gatwick experiencing 4-5 hours delays in luggage reclaim. All in all an inefficient experience with appalling communication to their customers. I should also mention that on their on-board crew supplying beverages operated in a very slow inefficient way which I have never experienced with any other airline.,0
QF142 AKL-SYD and QF42 SYD-CGK in economy. Got an exit row seat for the AKL-SYD leg very comfortable and spacious. B737 in great condition. Breakfast was great entertainment was good. SYD-CGK leg was unsatisfactory. A330 uncomfortable seat limited entertainment and unresponsive PTV. Horrible lunch but refreshments were good. Cabin crew were attentive in both flights.,1
Flew Manchester to Sharm on 8/11/12 and returned 22/11/12. Flight out OK as we had 3 seats between two of us. Flight back really uncomfortable due to poor cramped seating. We knew about the new catering arrangements and took our own food on both journeys as the Thomson offerings seem poor value for money. The lack of entertainment on a 6 hour flight is a joke. Staff on both flights were OK but they are obviously under orders to make as much money as possible.,0
Flew LHR-MEL-LHR return on A380. Outbound I sat downstairs booked extra legroom. The seat was very comfortable and the recline is great as the seat cushion slides out so the seat back doesn't recline as much as a normal seat. Foods was edible (it was much nicer on the LHR-DXB leg than the DXB-MEL leg). I managed to get some sleep too. Return leg I sat upstairs again in extra legroom seats. From all the good reviews I was looking forward to sitting upstairs but how wrong I was. I spent the whole journey to DXB with an inconsiderate woman in the seat behind me poking her screen and jolting my seat. She then moaned at me because I reclined my seat (when she was asleep). Another passenger then decided to shine an LED torch around a dark cabin looking for something blinding the rest of us. Cabin crew were brilliant though! Lovely attentive chatty happy! Been singing their praises ever since just a shame I had to share my experience with horrible selfish passengers.,1
1st June from LAX to JFK. Cabin crew were really unfriendly. They didn't smile at all and I was under the impression that they felt that we were a burden (the passengers). I have traveled extensively and on many airlines. I have to say this is the first time I have felt uncomfortable on a flight- even to the point that I was reluctant to ask for anything from the cabin crew.,0
Its all about the crew SYD-AUH-LHR EY455 - friendly efficient crew -long haul 14 hours to AUH and delayed out of SYD by an hour due to missing PAX. Good flight seat 35H. But this flight EY19 to LHR is like 'chalk and cheese' with a very unfriendly crew running out of food and disinterested in passengers why do the job?,1
2 flights Batam to KL and Penang to Phuket. Both good value on time and planes new and tidy. Efficient check-in and booking.,1
VCE-MAD. Lots of people at check-in but it was quick. Boarding by zones was chaotic due to passengers attitude staff was not to blame. Seats were comfortable and service was OK. There was a delay on departure but purser and captain apologized for that and we finally arrived only 15 minutes late. Overall a pleasant experience and very good value for money.,1
Bandung to Pekanbaru on 9th December. At the time I bought the tickets scheduled for 3.40 pm but 3 days prior to departure the schedule suddenly changed to 5.35 am. A very disappointing change.,0
"Flew round-trip SJC-LAS-SJC outbound on Sep 11 (flight 328) returning on Sep 14 (flight 259). The outbound flight was delayed 4 hours. Initially we had to wait for a couple of hours due to bad weather in LAS. That issue is not the airline's responsibility of course. However after we were told that LAS airport was open again we were delayed by about an hour because staff were not able to match the people on board with their passenger manifest. Cabin crew went through the cabin 3 times counting the number of passengers. A ground staff member went through the plane and checked our ID's one by one. Passengers were getting irritated as the clock ticked. Eventually they figured out that 1) a passenger made it into the plane without turning in a boarding pass and 2) a passenger was now without ID because the ground person checking the ID's left the aircraft with the ID and did not return it to the passenger. / Overall I think it was ""nicely done under the circumstances"" but the ground/gate agent(s) made things harder for the passengers and the cabin crew. The return flight from LAS to SJC was uneventful. The airfare was substantially cheaper than their competition and service was nice once we got airborne. I still recommend SWA to my friends and relatives for short non-stop trips.",1
When booking with Thomson I thought we were going to be flying with an above low budget. I thought wrong they are no better than the low budget airlines trying to cut back saving themselves a few pounds. We flew to Tenerife South from EMA in August 2012 the Thomson flight there was nice decent leg room and nice cabin crew. Though my boyfriend paid for some food (what a waste of money) chips were all stuck together and the chicken wrap where was the chicken? Also no air-conditioning which was not a noticeable problem when flying out. However on the way home the plane was hot and stuffy and very uncomfortable. Cabin crew staff were quite rude bumping into passengers and not saying sorry etc. I would not recommend flying them unless you have to fly less than 2.5 hours as it is unbearable. For saying we paid a lot of money for the flight we really didn't get our moneys worth. Disappointed.,0
Dusseldorf to Warsaw on board an Embraer 175. It was very comfortable journey cabin crew nice and helpful. Newspapers snacks and beer were complimentary. Flight on time.,1
"Just got off an excellent long haul Qatar Airways journey and came down with a bump connecting onto a domestic flight with Vietnam Airlines to Danang from Saigon (VN114 14/06/2015). Crew were usual grumpy and rude self, refusing to hang my suit up because that's apparently only a business class service. Chief purser had a terrible attitude and was very rude, basically ignoring me. Immediately after take off half the crew sat and relaxed in business class seats. The others passed out some water and joined them! They say they want to be a 4 star airline! I'm amazed they're even a 3 star one! ",0
MSP-Puerto Vallarta. From the moment we checked in at MSP/HHH throughout the flight to PV and returning to MSP a week later we had a great experience with Sun Country Airlines. Flight attendants were consistently friendly on both flights. We have flown Sun Country many many times and will continue to do so! I look forward to our next trip and flying with Sun Country Airlines!,0
Flight 199 on April 8 and flight 292 on April 11. I will never fly this airline again! They charge you 50 to 100 extra dollars to take a carry-on plus all kinds of other fees to fly. Buyer beware! I just wish I could give this airline a negative number. Yes it's that bad. Fly the other airlines. It will cost you less in the long run. Seats don't even recline!,0
HGH-PEK. The oldish but well maintained A320 was very clean and despite the high load factor (99%) cabin crew was keeping smile and worked in efficient way. Nevertheless the hot meal as a dinner was disgusting like every time flying this carrier. Leg room was ok but the best thing were those friendly men sitting next to me. Best value for money definitely will fly again.,1
We recently flew from KL to Brisbane on MH134. We have flown Malaysian several times both in economy and in business. Overall quite happy with the experience. The food is good although the gluten free options available to my partner are very limited and need improvement. The chef on call service available to business and first class passengers finally seems to be up and running. The service from cabin staff is excellent and very attentive. One negative is the delayed departures from Kl. This was the second flight we have taken from Kl where the flight was significantly delayed.. Malaysian airlines need to improve on this. Also the inflight entertainment choices are only average. We will probably fly Malaysian again although it will depend on price comparison with other airlines.,1
Paris to the Seychelles. The cabin itself is in good condition. the staff seemed a bit awkward and on the return flight was the entire crew were rude and arrogant. Food was as expected in the Economy. Despite seat reservation I had a different seat in the middle of three. I got no answer as to why my seat was changed.,0
I booked this Barcelona - Dubrovnik flight several months ago from New Zealand. I too had read many terrible reviews and I was really worried about this leg of a once In a lifetime trip for my wife and me. Well I needn't have worried because the day was flawless and their online service leading up to the day was also exemplary. Barcelona Airport and Vueling check-in was smooth the boarding flight and luggage were spot on. Could not fault the airline. I'm tall so I paid a little extra for legroom. Brilliant.,1
MEL-BNE-MEL SIN-KUL PEN-SIN SIN-KCH-SIN. All flights were punctual. Flights were bargain- basement cheap and one shouldn't compare the airline for a full-service airline. Would not hesitate to fly Tiger again!,1
I travelled to 5 countries in South America during July and October. Whilst travelling I flew LAN on 13 occasions: SCL-LIM-CUZ JUL-LIM LIM-SCL AEP-IGR (return) MVD-SCL SCL-IPL (return) SCL-LIM-LPB LPB-SCL. Throughout all flights I was greatly impressed by the efficiency of LAN. Ground and cabin crews were friendly and helpful. The LAN boxed meals on (one class) short flights was consistent. Cabin crew warm and welcoming. Trolley service by cabin crew was excellent despite the fact that the majority of flights were fully booked. The one sour point was that the inflight entertainment (IPL-SCL) failed in my section of the aircraft. However having had a tsunami alert whilst on Easter Island in the early hours of my departure day I relished the chance for a sleep. This flight is treated as an international flight. Hence a pillow and blanket was provided. Notwithstanding this fact I would have no trouble in recommending LAN.,1
Flight 764 Jan 11 2015. Montreal to Sint Maarten. Flight 765 Jan 18 2015. Sint Maarten to Montreal. We found the ground crew to be very courteous and that is where our compliments stop. I have never seen cabin seating so tight and I am only 5 ft tall. The planes are not only cramped but also outdated not having screens behind the seats. On our return voyage which departed Sint Maarten at 6.30 pm we did not see any cabin crew for 2 hours after take off. We could not get water or any beverages until halfway through the trip. I have travelled with Air Canada WestJet Thomas cook and Air Transat and have found those experiences more enjoyable. I will avoid any destination in the future if Sunwing is the carrier. It is most definitely not pleasant feeling like I am being herded like cattle in tight spaces. Surely with the money being saved on cheaper fuel today Sunwing could take out a few rows of seating In order to allow its passengers to be able to shift a little in their seat. On a final note I am happy that I did not pay a premium for Elite as the seats appeared to be at best 2 inches larger.,0
Tokyo Hanada-Beijing-Tokyo Narita in Business class. JAL has a nice first class lounge at Hanada airport great food and drinks nice facilities but does not have spa service. Business class seat is more like Qantas domestic business class seat. Hot meal served with good choice of drinks. Cabin crew friendly and professional. AVOD system is okay does not have great range of movies. JAL uses Beijing airport first lounge at PEK pretty average for first class lounge.,1
"I have flown in business class with BA on many occasions and found the service to be hit and miss. If you get an indifferent crew - which, in my experience, is not far off half the time - they want you to eat your dinner as fast as possible, go to sleep and not bother them any more. Once such a crew spot the blankets coming out they cease interest in you, never check on you, and leave you to ask for everything. I have never had that experience in business class with other airlines, for example Emirates, EVA or Lan Chile, quite the opposite. Anyway, BA were offering a special price to upgrade (cash only) to first on my Vancouver-Heathrow flight. I thought I'd try it. It was a waste of money. The first sign of trouble was the fact that I was not welcomed or addressed by name - an absolute must I think. Then the (male, and they tend to be the worst on BA, I am sorry to say) flight attendant came round handing out menus as though we were in economy - he just doled them out rather than hand them to, and speak to, each passenger in a personal manner. The wine selection didn't seem so very much better than business class and when I asked a specific question (flavour of champagne) the flight attendant didn't know the answer. I eat slowly and was still on my main course (lamb, and rather dry) when the dreaded time arrived for the blankets to make their appearance. I thought 'Oh no, surely not in first'. Well, I was wrong. I was left staring at my dirty plate and eventually had to summon the flight attendant and ask to see the menu for dessert. After that, unbelievably, I was abandoned again and, in protest, got up from my seat and went off in search of a crew member. I asked to speak to the cabin services director (female, delighful manner) who was full of apologies, of course, and off I went back to my seat. When I was finally given coffee, the flight attendant who brought it (another female) confided that BA don't have the staff numbers to pay the same attention to first or business passengers that some other airlines do, I couldn't believe my ears. As for the cabin, being in the nose of the 747,I felt cramped. The mood-changing lighting doesn't compensate for the dark, monotone blue of the seats and carpet. The in-light entertainment was to my surprise just the same as on the rest of the plane. I know this reads like a demolition job on BA but I have made no exaggerations. I really think Willie Walsh should don a false beard and shades and take a decent number of flights in business and first on his own planes. He'd find out for himself. I want BA to be the best and it simply isn't. Lastly, my experience of the hit and miss service of BA business class is shared by every other person I have ever mentioned it to. If you're flying BA stay in business class, you're not missing anything.",0
I was one of the unfortunate ones whose flights to and from Adelaide were cancelled. Had proper consideration and care been given to customers and appropriate alternate arrangements been made I would have had no cause for complaint. However this was not the case. The re-routing process was a nightmare. Only my partner was re-routed to Melbourne for our return flight while I had to resubmit the request after a few days. Upon checking in at Melbourne airport we were advised that our KL to Penang sector was on different flights and were told to go to the transfer desk at KLIA2. First their customer service centre denied receiving my emails even though I was showing them to the lady at the transfer counter. Then after a few enquiries they said they had not changed my KL- Penang flight because the earlier flight I had requested had only one remaining space left which my partner was transferred into. They apparently did not think it was important to notify us of this to allow sufficient time to make other arrangements. I was told that my flight was full too so he couldn't come on mine on boarding I noticed an empty spot right next to me and another one across the aisle. We arrived in Penang 2.5 hours apart. Not only did I have to pay an additional 300AUD per person for my trip it took me more than twice the length of time it usually takes me on MAS. Flights were on time and thankfully we reached Penang safely. But service was non existent. Hoping the return journey will be less distressing.,0
I flew AMS-LGW-MCO and JFK-LHR-AMS this month. Overall is was an acceptable experience. Food and drinks the normal airline stuff. Staff were good and visited us often. I only found the seats very unpleasant.,1
Rio - Madrid - Geneva. Flight from Rio was one hour late but the staff onboard were perfect. The food was excellent and the Airbus 340 seemed less noisy than others. Breakfast served one hour prior to landing so we had plenty of time to sleep with no silly announcements. Second leg was very smooth as well. The only glitch is the poor onboard entertainment with very little choice. Overall I would recommend them again.,1
Dumaguete-Manila return. No problem flying from Dumaguete but the flight back from Manila to Dumaguete on the same day diverted due to low visibility. Flight diverted to Cebu for onward flight to Manila. We were told we could fly back the next morning from Manila and they were not responsible for our accommodation. If we did not want to go back to Manila we could get off at Mactan airport and we would have to make our way to Dumaguete at our expense. We ended up hiring a taxi to Bato that evening so we did not have to stay overnight in Cebu.,0
SYD-LHR return via ICN. This airlines 5 star status was reflected in all sectors the cabin crew were excellent. The food Western and Korean was delicious and delivered in a timely and unhurried manner. The price paid for the ticket represented excellent value for money there was also the bonus of arriving in LHR around 6pm at which time immigration and customs are a breeze.,1
"I use to travel from Brussels to Miami via Madrid at least four times a year. Iberia is improving its service dramatically! The aircraft assigned to that route is a brand new Airbus 330-300. The entertainment is excellent individual screen lots of movies series music maps. The flights depart and arrive on time and the connexion in Madrid Barajas is fast and smooth. The cabin crew is much much nicer than before. Yes there are still some ""old style"" cabin crew members who perform their work without a smile but most of the members now are nice helpful and smiley. The food is just ok. The price is unbeatable!! It is the best ratio price/quality in the market for those flights. I am happy to fly Iberia.",1
MSP-RSW. No room in seats expected pay for everything surprised I wasn't asked to swipe a card to unlock the bathroom door on the airplane. We got in a 20 mins early thought this was great until we got to baggage claim (forced to check a bag for 40 lbs) it had been well over an hour no announcement for any delay for the first hour. They are blaming it on flights ahead of ours. Not one person on the flight has seen a bag yet. Never again!,0
LHR-BOS on newly acquired A330-300 flight VS11 returning on the same aircraft flight VS12 some 2 weeks later. We booked Premium Economy both ways and were interested to see how the new aircraft compared to the A340-600 and the B747 we had used with VA over the past 20 years making the same trip. Our flight out was fine (day flight) with all of the staff very attentive and efficient. Refreshments were plentiful and the food ok. The new Premium Economy seats were just about acceptable given the quite short leg room. Boarding excellent. Return journey (night flight) was very disappointing with quite a late dinner leaving about 2+ hours for some sleep before time for their so called breakfast. This night flight seemed understaffed or were very inefficient but the most disappointing aspect was how uncomfortable the seating was when the person in front put their seats back into the fully reclining position. Being only just over 6 feet tall the seat pressed on my knees for most of the time making any sleep impossible. Also very difficult to get up to stretch or visit the washroom. The food was substandard and poorly presented. What a disappointment bring back Premium Economy in the bubble of the 747's or can I suggest that VA management take a trip and fly Premium Economy with Air New Zealand to see how it should be done!,0
"10/6/15, LHR-GLA, A321, Seat 9A.  Was able to choose this seat in advance which has plenty of legroom as no seat in front.  Flight was pretty full.  Cabin crew were all extremely friendly and helpful welcoming every passenger individually.  Flight was delayed by difficulty in storing the silly amount of carry on baggage people brought on board.  Some stuff was obviously way bigger than the allowed size.  It took ages to get it all sorted which was ridiculous, however the crew kept smiling though it all.  Again new configuration seating which I found pretty comfortable.  Drink and snack was served as usual.  Landed nearly 30 mins late to discover my baggage had not made it from GRR which was quite annoying.  Overall good flight though.",1
FRA-SVO-OVB. New and spotless A320 plane. Comfortable seats and decent food on both legs. Colleagues had warned me about SVO but found Terminal D in SVO to be first class: very efficient good signage good services. Both planes late by 30 mins but that's about the only negative thing I can say. All in all a good value for money.,1
We flew from London to Manila via Shanghai. The service on the aircraft was very poor with most of the cabin crew having very limited English. The food was just about edible. Getting served was very hit and miss with some crew just walking up and down the aisle with drinks and not asking each passenger if they wanted anything. It was up to passengers to attract their attention and many time people were just ignored. Some staff were friendly some barely hid their contempt for the passengers. We booked a baby bassinet but it wasn't provided and the cabin crew couldn't even understand what we wanted when we asked so we had to spend a 13 hour flight with a baby on our laps. No children's meals were provided even though we booked them. We checked the baby buggy at the gate in Heathrow. When we got to Shanghai it had disappeared and it took us several hours of speaking to unhelpful staff to get it back. Shanghai airport is a huge gloomy depressing place with zero facilites beyond basic seating and horrifically expensive shops. 8GBP for a fruit juice. All in all the worst airline I have flown with by a wide margin. For an international airline the lack of language skills and training of the staff is inexcusable and the staff's attitude to the people who pay their wages is totally unacceptable.,0
This was my first time attempting to fly with Monarch and I will never try this again. The date of travel was 8th Sept 2014 when there was a security alert at Luton Airport where the flight was to originate. I will only address my remarks to Monarch rather than the chaos and mayhem which occurred at the airport. The basic problem was their complete lack of communication with passengers and the complete lack of any Monarch representatives at the airport. All the other airlines were decisive even if it meant the cancellation of flights and made some effort to assist their passengers. I could not help noticing that Ryanair were the first back on their feet and giving coherent advise to their passengers. After waiting hours after the other airlines Monarch cancelled everything giving no guidance as to how we should get out of the departure area when and where we could get our baggage back what if anything we were now being offered etc. The screens in the baggage arrival hall were out of action and it appears that Monarch simply put all the bags from their cancelled flights on any carousel where space was available even if these were being used for the now incoming flights as well. I could go on about this airline where unrelated strike action is now forecast which gives me yet another reason not to use them again.,0
JFK-GRU-SCL SCL-ASU-GRU-JFK. Flights on time boarding was pretty much orderly. Planes clean legroom and seat comfort decent. Cabin crew on shorter sectors seemed friendlier and obliging. You get 3 choices for a main meal in Economy. IFE was very limited and on the old A330 from JFK it didn't work at all. Only 4 toilets for a packed Economy cabin on the A330 meant lines throughout the flight. B777 was better. Crew on long international sector well groomed but not friendly or engaging. Meals are really tiny - catering portions pretty much the same regardless of the length of flight. No refills on coffee or drinks. Meal quality was fair to disappointing. Considering the options going to South America from the US - they are still miles ahead of any American carrier. That's not saying much.,1
We had Air France tickets from Malaga to JFK and back from MEX connecting flights to/from Paris with Air Europa. Air Europa does not provide 24-hour online check-in. We arrived 80 minutes prior to departure at check-in in Malaga to find a huge queue that moved very slowly. 3 check-in staff only ours was rather unpleasant and grumpy. With 20 minutes to go for departure we were running to security leaving behind about 30 more passengers waiting to be checked-in. Arrived at the gate to be told to rush onto the plane. Onboard the most uncomfortable airline seat old and worn and hardly reclineable. They are also too short so half your thighs don't fit the seat and it inclines downwards so one has the unpleasant feeling of sliding off! Despite the delay we made our connection in Paris. On the return we checked-in online via Aeromexico (still all on AF tickets) but the Air Europa connection Paris-Malaga did not yield seat assignments nor boarding passes. At check-in in MEX we were told they could not help us because when you check-in online this apparently messes up the boarding pass/seating process on Air Europa. Once in Paris AF staff at the connection counter finally printed boarding passes for Air Europe. Yet again the seats were very uncomfortable and old and barely acceptable for a 2-hour flight. Staff just like on the outbound were very indifferent. If at all possible I would avoid Air Europa in the future. I can handle unpleasant staff but I would avoid them purely because of the discomfort of the seats on their B737 that seem to be at least 20 years old.,0
As a professional and frequent traveler on other airlines I had tried Insel Air and was choked by the poor service and treatment given to passengers on flight from Miami to Haiti on June 19 2012. An apology would be in order. Also all announcements are made in English there should be at least one Haitian hostess speaking both French and Creole. Hostesses on board were inexperienced. If Insel is not ready to service this line they should withdraw themselves until able to do so respectfully. Plane leaves full every time meaning that this route is profitable to the company. Hope my next review will be more positive.,0
Worst experience ever! Cancelled our connecting flight out of JFK leaving us stranded at their hell hole of a terminal for 20 hours and telling us that the next available flight was almost 3 days later. Employees spent their time sleeping chatting with one another or doodling on notepads. Bathrooms were disgusting. Every employee gave us different and conflicting information or showed no interest in helping us at all. Lost our bag and then told us that they wouldn't ship it to us we had to drive back to our final airport destination and pick it up. I will never fly with Delta ever again.,0
"Frankfurt is too big for transfers between A and Z gates unless this airline helps passengers with carts or at least notifies next gate of that passengers are on their way. Our intl luggage didn't make the connection all due to what LH called ""damage"" to the first plane which was solved with a 30 minute late arrival to BUD. We were traveling from BUD to IAD through FRA and it was gruelling and impossible for someone with bags or who can't sprint for 1 mile.",0
BKK-CDG. This was my first flight with Air France (and last). What a big disappointment it was. On a 12.5-hour flight I thought we would be served plenty of food and drink. First serving was ok but after that the service was extremely poor. The cabin crew sat in the galley chatting with each other the whole trip. I bothered the staff by asking if i could get a glass of juice and some snacks. I could not believe what I heard when they said that they had run out juice snacks and sandwiches. Second serving came about two hours before landing or nine hours since we last ate so we were really hungry but the food was pitiful and inedible. The only positive thing on this flight was the IFE. I strongly advise against traveling with Air France but if you do it despite this warning don't forget to bring sandwiches with you.,0
Flew PHL to SJU return. US Airways use a 757 that was originally configured to fly the transatlantic routes on some of these services. The seats were proper old-style business class cradle type with great leg room and plenty of recline. Service excellent. Food good. No in-flight entertainment on either sector. Would definitely choose US Airways on this route if they continue using their 757s with the ex-long haul configuration. Both flights on-time.,1
San Diego to Miami - seating was so tight I couldn't read a magazine when the seat in front of me reclined. Extra charges for everything. A truly horrible experience but it was non-stop and they were punctual.,0
Melbourne-Canberra and return in B737s. Very smooth check-ins at the kiosks and bag drops. On both legs the planes operated on time or a little early. The cabin interiors were a bit tired and the seats a bit tight but the in- flight service was friendly and the snacks served were fine. Wine and beer were available on the late afternoon flight from Canberra. I travelled using Emirates Miles. I could not check-on online on either the Qantas or Emirates websites. The seats I had chosen when booking on the Emirates website were not honoured by Qantas.,1
Late late late! I have a multi-leg trip and 2 of the 3 flights so far have been late. The flight cheered when we landed on time in Nicaragua - I asked why because they are always late! not delayed - late! 4 hours on the flight from Honduras (ended up getting in at am) to Guatemala and 1.5HRS (so far) on the flight from Nicaragua to Costa Rica.,1
"Flight from Bulgaria to Glasgow 25th June 2013. First got to leave early due to all passengers on the plane so very pleased arrived back home 45 minutes earlier than expected. Got extra legroom seats at the front of the cabin this was the middle of the night and the plane was freezing when asked if they had a blanket or something I could purchase was told ""no"" that was it. I can deal with cold weather but my feet arms and face were almost blue it was the security at passport control that asked if I was okay. I asked then if I could move seat due to the plane not being busy but was told no due to safety that is all fair and well but bring ice cold on a plane isn't the best thing. Never again will I be travelling with Thomas Cook Airlines and will definitely not recommend to a friend.",0
VS200 LHR-SYD in Y+. I was advised at the gate in HKG that my IFE was not working so was given 20GBP vouchers for in sky shopping. The IFE eventually worked and the voucher was honoured! Again pleasant crew but poor quality food and very limited drinks choice. I am in 2 minds about VS. I think they need to lift their game a bit. Flight left HKG late so we would not get to SYD before the curfew lifted. That could be planned better.,1
LGW-Antigua on 29 April and Antigua-LGW on 13 May Boeing 777. It started off badly when I went to pay the final payment on line on evening of 16 February. The system rejected both my credit and debit cards. On checking the state of my account with BA online I found that the final payment had been credited to my account and I now owed the initial deposit. I sent an email to get it sorted only to receive a reply that it could only be sorted out by a telephone call. First call was useless with a person who had poor grasp of English. Another call to a premium number required a 20 minute wait to get someone to sort out the problem having been passed round twice. I was told it had been sorted out and received E ticket email with my state of account showing I owed nothing. Two weeks later I received another E ticket the only difference now was that it showed the last four digits of my credit card. Next credit card statement did not show money taken out. Not unusual for some companies but made me nervous that all was not well. Two weeks before flight I got a phone call from BA stating that there had been a computer glitch and could they have my credit card details. I then received an email apology and confirmation all had been paid. About 22 hours before flight I went online to check in and changed my seats and entered passport details etc and printed boarding pass. Arrived at LGW to just print baggage labels and drop off baggage. Met by man at terminal who tore up my boarding pass and printed off a new one saying ?bring back the old system. We then had to queue to drop off baggage. Other than choosing seat it was a complete waste of time to check in online. Flight left and arrived on time. However the inflight main meal was the worst I have ever experienced on an aircraft. There was no choice and the red wine was undrinkable. The inflight food on my first flight a forces trooping flight to Singapore in 1962 was better. On return flight you could only check in online and alter seat position. Check in at Antigua was one of the quickest check ins I have ever done. Left Antigua on time and arrived LGW on time. Food was worse than going out. No choice. Starter was small chopped up lettuce leaf with small tomato wedge with a rotten end to it. Main was very dry pasta with a tomato sauce on it. White wine was just about drinkable. Coffee served as we started main course. Asked if we could have it later and told no as turbulence was expected. No turbulence but cabin crew quick to clear up and disappear for a bit of shut eye leaving minimum staff on duty. At least with Ryanair you know what you get for your money.,0
Flew business class MNL-NRT-LAX and back. Food was better the last time I flew with them (2 years ago). Service a hit or miss - sometimes you get a friendly FA sometimes you come across a robot-like one. On my return trip I checked in 2 pieces of luggage one weighing 23kg and the other 33kg. The lady at the check in counter said I needed to pay 200usd for the overweight baggage and I was horrified. I said but my other bag is just 23kg! Then I should just transfer 1kg of my heavy bag to the lighter one. I was in disbelief! I felt like I was flying economy for the treatment I was getting. Remedied only when I had asked her to call her supervisor.,1
I initially booked an Air Canada flight (LAX-YVR return) but after a while I was told by e-mail that my itinerary had been changed to Air Canada Rouge. Fortunately the timing of the flights was similar to those I booked. The flight was OK but the seating was too tight (and I am not a tall person).,0
Flight 305 1/3/14. I have flown with them before but quite few years ago so assumed they would of gone downhill like so many airlines but what a pleasant surprise nothing had changed! Great service from the cabin crew comfortable seating really nice food and best of all a brilliant IFE system. I have flown with Cathay Pacific and Malaysian a lot and they are good but no where near the same class as Singapore.,1
HEL-SIN in July 2012 was a terrible experience. Delayed 2hrs where we sat inside the plane waiting. Then the seat didn't hold it looked old. The screen was scratched and tiny. Many times the films didn't work properly. Next the food came really late and it was horrible - served with plastic utensils. No in-flight package on top was a bit too much. Really need to get up to speed.,0
Frankfurt-Rome-Tblisi. Check-in Frankfurt is done together with Air France/KLM in T2 - very efficient. Frankfurt-Rome on time with beverage service. Crew okay. No newspapers on this flight. Rome-Tblisi at odd Hours arrived in Tblisi at 5 am. Flight only 70% booked so I had plenty of space. Food was good though cold only. IFE limited. Baggage took quite a long time to arrive on the belt. Would fly again.,1
Booked a trip via American Airlines and my flight from London to Seattle was on BA. What a treat. I wish all my AA trips were done by BA. Great service leg space beautiful gates airplanes. The 8.5 hr trip went by quickly. TV in every seat with plenty of great choices. Food was good and flight attendants were helpful and patient.,1
Flew SA 78 From Windhoek to Johannesburg and then on ward to Lilongwe on SA 170 both flights operated by a Boeing 737-800. Food was good seats comfortable and ground crew in Windhoek were great as I arrived late for check in and they were closing the flight but they still checked me and transfer at Johannesburg was smooth as I already had my JNB-LLW boarding pass issued to me in Windhoek. Would not hesitate to fly them again.,1
HEL-NRT on 19/8/2013. The aircraft for the route was a new B787 which is quiet and comfortable as such. The service was Japanese style - extremely polite yet distant. Food in business class was a strange mix of excellent and mediocre dishes. The seat was not a very comfortable seat for a nearly 190 cm height. It was not lie flat seat and was uncomfortable for a business class seat. All in all a fine service but not great.,0
"Was curious to try Qatar, having flown Emirates numerous times between S Africa and Europe. Qatar's pricing is a major draw-card, they were significantly cheaper than Emirates. The trip out of JNB to DOH was great, the plane was not full and a lot of passengers had spare seats around them. Not sure that it would have been as pleasant with a full plane. Having heard so much about the Boeing 787, I was expecting it to be state-of-the-art flying, but I can't say that was the case. The seats are as hard  and very cramped - these seats rate very poorly against the Boeing 777, and the only way I could grab any sleep was by sleeping against the window. The food was really good, and I love the containers they use - much better than any other airline I have flown with recently. Entertainment is great - the range is not quite as extensive as Emirates or BA, but streets ahead of Turkish Airlines. One gripe is that the crew would only serve one drink with dinner, I couldn't have a pre-dinner drink and a glass of wine. Thought that was rather mean. The flight between Doha and Istanbul was also good, despite it being a full flight on a narrow body aircraft. Return flight was great too, my only gripe is that every leg of the journey entailed a bus to get to the terminal building, and another back out. That would be okay if you weren't left in the 38 degree heat. Other than that, I can't fault Qatar.",1
Flew YYC-LAS roundtrip. Check-in people were friendly and courteous. We were processed quickly. Received bags at both locations fairly fast. Only one beverage run during the entire 2 hr 38 min flight. Two complaints. We found the seats to be narrower than average and we were not sure we would want to fly for a longer time. Secondly approx 1/3 of the TV channels were not offered due to various issues. Disappointing when they advertise 24 channels and you only get about 15 of which few are children oriented. The screens are also very small.,1
Singapore - Jakarta. Flight over 1 hr late which I expected as Changi Airport departures showed this flight as late every day for the previous week. Captain apologised for the slight delay but apologies become meaningless when the airline keeps doing it! The airline should drop or reschedule this flight to a time within their capabilities as it isn't at the moment. It's certainly cheap and the attendants did their jobs satisfactorily but persistent lateness isn't acceptable.,0
12 April 2014 Departed LHR flight no 729. Flight was 1 hour late taking off due to aircraft not being ready for passenger seating cleaning and food availability. Inflight entertainment was average seating as expected for economy class food was satisfactory but as a vegetarian I do not find it acceptable that the airline had run out of vegetarian options. I then had to wait a while for a vegetarian option to arrive. Landing was smooth arriving an hour later than scheduled meant there was not enough time to complete customs and security checks. Upon arriving at customs we were greeted by a spiralling queue of extremely anxious passengers customs were unable to manage the large quantity of passengers this resulted in us waiting for more than 1 hour no provision made for late arriving passengers to be fast tracked through customs to allow us to board our connecting flight. We were reassured that the flight would not take off without us. We ran to the gate displayed on the departures board and when we arrived at our gate we were disappointed to find that the flight had taken off without us. We waited to speak to a customer service representative for over 2 hours. We asked to be put on the next available flight and got no response was booked onto 10am flight the next morning. I asked where we would stay for the next 12 hours staff member shrugged. We walked away from customer services feeling so disappointed. We spent the night in the airport. Decided to approach customer service again totally different attitude and approach. Given a freshen up bag put us on standby for the 6am flight to Orlando. We arrived at the gate patiently and we were lucky to be boarded on this flight. Finally arrived at our destination 12 hours later. Luckily our baggage was waiting in the bag claim office. I would never fly with this airline again.,0
Booked a flight for my son to travel from Gold Coast to Melbourne. After a delay of 4.5 hours Tiger decided to cancel the flight. Cost me another $429 to book another flight with a different airline for the next day. Magically all other flight prices increased dramatically. Tiger said they will refund airfare but it will take 2 weeks. Last time we fly with this airline. You obviously get what you pay for.,0
"I found the service very mediocre, we were delayed for nearly 2 hours in Toronto. On the 24th of June we were due to take off at 9.55pm and it took until 10.20/30 for the pilot to tell us we were delayed due to the fact that they need a tyre changed on the aeroplane! This was not too much of a problem but time went on and we were not offered any refeshments while waiting for takeoff. It was hot and stuffy, and it was only when several passengers started asking for water, including myself, that they decided to go around with a jug of water and small plastic glasses. The plane did not take off until 11.55. We got dinner at 1.00am in the morning and breakfast was a slice of cake and a hot dinner, who has cake for breakfast! I know its any economy airline, but surely refreshments should have been offered if the plane was delyed and what nutritional value does cake have for breakfast?",0
AT850 last Monday. A good flight with RAM. 738(RGJ) this aircraft has a sky interior that was very nice. Crew were not too friendly. The food was good and service was not bad for the price I paid (??05). I really like the seats. One thing RAM needs to do: FA's need to be more friendly to passengers.,1
MU563 Shanghai to Delhi July 5. They boarded the plane and then announced a 2 hour delay. The in-flight service was less than friendly. When I asked for a sandwich it was given to me in my hand in a cheap cling wrap without a plate - this is in Business Class. The entire crew struggled with English communication was very difficult. In Business Class while they had a decent choice of movies the remote used for it was ancient. What really upset me after the final good bye and thank you announcement in Chinese they give a gracious bow with hands folded but there's nothing like that after the English announcement.,0
ZRH-BEY via SAW return. ZRH-SAW delayed 1 hour due to late arrival of incoming flight. B737-800 clean and boarding efficient on all sectors. Very good value for money 3 out of 4 sectors on time. SAW airport new and comfortable for 2 hour transit.,1
OS854 6 April 2015. Flight Venice-Wien-Amman. Extremely poor experience. My flight Venice - Wien was cancelled and I was told about that only late evening before the early morning flight on Whatsapp so that I had no possibility to take their connection Wien - Amman. I phoned them and they gave me an Alitalia - Royal Jordanian flight which made me arrive 6 hours later than planned. I completely lost all the pre-paid tourist services planned for that afternoon in Jordan.,0
"Every time I fly United something happens to derail my trip or make my trip miserable. This trip we missed our connecting flight because we sat on the tarmack in Boston for an hour because they were having delays in loading luggage.  We missed our connecting flight by 10 minutes and are now stuck overnight in Denver. So let me see, they could have waited 5-10 minutes for us to make our scheduled flight, or not wait and pay hotel and food for two people. What kind of business sense is that? This was my last straw with United - I will avoid this airline at all costs. ",0
Flew last week from Munich to Tyunmen (TJM / Siberia). B-735 with European-style business cabin (middle seat free). Smooth check-in; my coat was taken by a smiling attendant but no help to put my 8-kg luggage in the locker. No entertainment during the 5 1/2 hours journey (red-eye) but more than decent meal with appetisers and good (Chilean?) wine. I hope that my return flight in two days will be at least as peaceful although the linguistic capacities of the crew should be improved.,1
Frankfurt-Mauritius and back 6/10-14/10. Very unsatisfied with the service from the beginning until the end. No room in the seats at all no kindness they will not see me on board again!,0
"Had a flight from Dunedin to Auckland. Scheduled to leave at 1900 left at 2050. Seems they were short of a steward. Classy (not) scanning of boarding passes. I have never heard ""OK [giggle] you can all go now."" Then waiting for a shuttle at AKL with a passenger from Wgtn (also on a flight with a long delay). Seems she was told the same story of being short of a steward. Two domestic flights delayed for hours with the same excuse. What is going on?",0
AMS to BKK about 6 to 7 times per year Lounges both ways quite good. Recently refurbished (last 12 months) the 747's which were good but now have reverted to the A340 and seats definitely far poorer. Please change back! Also the flight time has increased dramatically due to fuel saving flying at much lower speeds.,1
"My wife and I were checking in our luggage  for our flight from Hamburg to Geneva when a person who identified himself as the ?enforcer??(his term) approached us and informed me that I had to also check in my carry-on. This was a surprise since  it was below Germanwings allowable size.  The enforcer instructed the ticket agent to weigh my carry-on. Unfortunately, it did exceed the 8kg weight limit. My only option was to remove excess weight, which I did. I removed clothing and gifts until I reached the 8 kg limit and placed them in the garbage pail provided by the ticket agent. I believe in following rules, but they need to be clearly indicated and consistently applied. This experience was in itself unpleasant. We checked in an extra piece of luggage and had to go to another agent to pay a 75 euro surcharge. However, we were informed that the surcharge would be 150 Euros for 2 pieces of luggage. The 2 agents communicated by phone and eventually discovered that we had erroneously been charged for an extra suitcase. ",0
My flight to South Africa with my 6 month old was fine in fact quite enjoyable. Unfortunately our return flight could not have been any worse due to the over booking and re-seating process. We were we tossed from pillar to post as the seat we had been allocated was taken to re-seat a mother and daughter. I was then offered another seat which was next to another re-seated passenger obviously put out as he had been downgraded due to the plane being overbooked. I was then re-seated for a final time in between 2 people. It was certainly not ideal with a 7 month old as I could not get up easily if I needed to settle my son. I felt the service in this case fell well below the standard I expected and below that which I experienced on the outbound flight.,0
8 flights in 6 weeks with 'The Pride of Africa'. 4 flights without the inflight entertainment working. Whole rows of seats had similar problems. All 777. Staff not able nor did they appear to care about the problems. Letter to KQ had a few platitudes back. Don't fly KQ long haul.,0
My 9.30 LH309 flight on 23/3/2014 out of Florence Italy was cancelled due to rain. Only one Lufthansa representative was available to rebook the entire flight's customers. After retrieving our luggage waiting in a long line to rebook through your only available representative in Florence we were to board a bus to take us to Bologna leaving at 13.00. It actually left at 14.15. No representative guided us with instructions on which bus to get on. When we arrived in Bologna one Lufthansa representative said to get into Line 35. When we approached the Lufthansa representative at Line 35 she got annoyed that we were in the wrong line. When I pointed out the gentleman who told us to get in her line she grabbed my ticket and approached that man. She came back without my ticket and told us we couldn't check in until 2 hours before the flight. Finally I got out of line and approached the man showed him my passport to get my ticket back. The meal voucher we were given in Florence was not honored in Bologna. Finally we got our baggage checked and seats assigned in Bologna 2 hours before our flight. When we arrived in Frankfurt no representative was there to greet us and walk us to where we were to get hotel vouchers. The whole experience was awful. Stress levels could have been lessened if Lufthansa people were well-informed and actually gave us correct information and were there to actually meet us and show us where or what we had to do. Walking around the airports in Bologna and Frankfurt with luggage on a wild goose chase because Lufthansa representatives didn't have a clue or gave us misdirection's was very bad mismanagement of customers and very poor customer service. I understand they cannot control the weather but Lufthansa CAN control the information given to customers after a cancellation and actually have representatives in place to guide us at each airport.,0
KUL-KTM 9 Oct MH 114. Below average service from the FA and disgusting food. It took them an hour and a half after takeoff to serve meals and there was no turbulence to delay it. Platinum status not acknowledged as well as names not used at all by the unfriendly lead stewardess and her crew. It's a pity the way this once great airline is headed.,0
I choose Alaska over United on my flights from LAX to PDX or SEA because they fly 737 and not commuters and offer a better Coach product than United. Crew seems happy to be there and they have hot food to purchase with good coffee! Having Wifi is a plus as well.,1
"When we arrived (4 passengers) and waited 40 minutes to check bags, we were told that we only arranged for two bags and would have to pay for two bags. But because agent could not take payment, we needed to go to customer service to pay. She filled out a form and told us to pay and return to front of line and they would held the plane. We still had over 1.5 hours. So, we waited in line at customer service for almost an hour and was told that we owed them Â£20 for 2 Kilos. I informed her that it was 2 bags not 2 kilos. so, we were sent back to the baggage line to get the correct form. We went to front of line as instructed and crowd was unhappy. Our agent had left. But, we got the correct form and returned to front of customer service line, crowd was unhappy, and was told that it would be Â£400, that is almost $800 US dollars for 2 bags. We tried to sort that out but to no avail. We were told to read the small print over and over. So, I agreed to pay and was told it was too late, that the flight was closed. So, we had to buy new tickets on another airline at another airport. They sell you tickets at a low price and then through small print charge you for seat, printing boarding passes, extra baggage etc. ",0
Dublin to Sydney (via Heathrow and Singapore). Club Europe from Dublin to London and club world to Sydney. Flight to Heathrow delayed 40 mins due to weather which was fine. Upon arrival in Heathrow waited for an hour for the bus transfer leaving us 30 mins to make the next flight. Upon boarding the connection bus another 30 mins delayed. By this time it was about 10pm. Obviously missed the connecting flight to Sydney so tried to find a BA contact in terminal 4. Was then advised to go to terminal 1. No BA reps around and no 24 hr phone number. Then transferred to terminal 5. By this time it was midnight and still no BA contacts. Finally went to baggage services and saw a BA rep that had no idea what was going on and sent us to the first class lounge which was closed. Finally someone appeared at 1am who sorted out our hotel room and as the delay was caused by BA they provided us with the option of flying back to Sydney on BA or could see if they could get us on a China Southern flight (we had originally booked China Southern). We took the BA option as it was easiest and needed to come home. Next day arrived at airport and boarded through Gate C in terminal 5 (hate Heathrow airport). Lounge in Heathrow was fine over crowded but fine. Upon boarding the BA business class product we were very disappointed to say the least. Seats old aircraft old and the seating configuration was awful. We had the two middle seats E and F which were facing backwards however the seats on opposite sides are very close facing towards you. Flight left on time and arrived in Singapore on time. There was a delay of an hour in Singapore but again that couldn't be helped. They were also out of the express passes which was annoying and also lost our baggage - luckily it arrived two days later. Good luck if you're expecting to sleep on the flight. Seats were small and very uncomfortable. The amenity kits were ok however they ran out of eye masks. The hit towels were anything but hot. Food was below average. Overall I wouldn't recommend British Airways Club Europe/world. The best I've experienced so far from Sydney to Europe would have to be on China Southern. Considering they are 2-3 grand cheaper than British Airways and they offer a better business class product and a more seamless transfer process.,0
"The plane sat on the tarmac for an hour (flight attendants even went through the safety announcement) before the pilot announced a problem with an engine that had to be tested. Another hour passed while they tested the engine. We then had to ""deplane"" because they couldn't fix the engine. We were herded onto another plane and they took us yet again through the safety procedures. Then they proceeded to offer us tea and coffee for which they charged 2.5 euros. Because of the delay I missed my international flight by half an hour. Nevertheless the flight attendants insisted all those with connecting flights go to the terminals where their flights had already left. I spent 3.5 hrs trudging through Heathrow trying to get home. Finally after going through security 3 times in one day I arrived back at the Aer Lingus desk at terminal one. They gave me a voucher for a hotel that they told me (and wrote on the voucher form) was in Terminal 4. It was in Terminal 5. Another hour of trudging around Heathrow trying to find the hotel. The new flight I was booked on did not leave for 24 hours. Aer Lingus is the worst airline I have ever experienced. Never travel with Aer Lingus.",0
Four domestic flights within China during June. The flights were all on time except the first from Shanghai to Beijing which was delayed for 30 minutes. Meals served on three of the flights and the food standard was quite good. Seat pitch very good for economy. Baggage delivery extremely prompt. Can recommend this airline.,1
NBO-DOH-SGN. Aircraft's A320 and A330-200 respectively. No lounge access could be granted in NBO despite being a gold card holder. Hotel provided in Doha (upon prior request) as layover exceeded 8 hours. However due to Xmas transitters for hotels were stuck in immigration queues for almost 2 hours! It has hardly worth it. However the 4-star hotel provided in Doha was OK but somehow scraped. Doha-Saigon upgraded to business class from seat 30K to 1F. The business class standards are high food options plenty and service quick despite business class became full - mainly by those upgraded from economy which was completely overbooked. Seats not fully lie flat in the configuration encountered this time. A delay from Doha was unusual long for Qatar Airways. As a result we came to SGN 40 minutes late so I lost my onward connection and had to purchase new ticket from VN-airlines.,1
"Intercontinental Asia-Europe Feb 2012. Quality of catering very low! Over an 11 hr flight - first meal of dry noodles and a few chicken slices meal number two (""light lunch"") was plain penne pasta with tomato sauce served 8 hrs after meal number one. Nothing in between only water and soft drinks. A significant lack of service! I'm very surprised about the poor quality!",0
Terrible airline. Will never fly again. On one of the busiest days of the year Frontier delayed our departure for almost 4 hours and then cancelled. Since they have no airline affiliations they couldn't offer any other travel options only option was a flight two days later or refund of ticket. They gave us our money back but it doesn't exactly cover the loss of our vacation planned months in advance. I've learned to always check if the airline has co-operating airlines with which they can rebook passengers.,0
London Heathrow-Chicago O'Hare UA0929. Chicago O?Hare Intl-Denver UA1014 29th May 2013. Denver-Rapid City UA4914. Rapid City-Chicago O?Hare UA4414. Chicago O?Hare-London Heathrow UK. UA0938 23rd June 2013. I cannot understand United are not upping their care for its customers. We flew with United on our last holiday and quite honestly never again. We have flown to many places around the world and United without any doubt are the worst airline I have used. The cabin crew are lazy and somewhat rude doing as little as they can. They could not even ask for the window blinds to be raised when coming in to land at London Heathrow. They did a standard talk when we were on the plane (with a special welcome to our premium and military customers). So quite obviously the economy passengers do not matter remembering of course that it is economy passengers that are the bulk of their customers.,0
"Hong Kong to Newark in Business Class. Good flight attendant and a very comfortable bed. Unfortunately the Fasten Seatbelt Sign came on at least 8 times during the 14 hour flight and many times for the smallest turbulence which most passengers ignored. However a very loud recorded message came on every time that said ""Ladies and Gentlemen the captain has turned on the fasten seatbelt sign please make sure your seatbelt is securely fastened"". Because of this announcement I could never sleep more than 90 minutes at a time.",0
Having flown Easyjet since 2005 I can certainly say they have gone downhill. What happened to that friendly fun cabin crew and low cost flights from friendly low cost airports? They have just become a boring and typical traditional airline a bit like a cheap BA. You now have to either reserve seats or hope that you get the seats you want when checking in further increasing the costs if you want to sit together in good seats. I much prefer the format of paying a bit extra for priority boarding and choosing to sit wherever you like. I found cabin crew to be too pushy to sell items as they kept waking people up with announcements every 20 minutes. I also found the range of food and drink on board to be small and were out of stock with most items by the time they were a third of the way down the cabin. They are also concentrating too much on Gatwick Airport and making reductions elsewhere. They stopped flying from East Midlands and have now cut back drastically at Stansted now they serve Southend which is disastrous for anybody living outside of Essex or East London. With now only having any decent service from London Bristol and the Liverpool/Manchester area in England I am finding them increasing unattractive to fly and am sticking more to Ryanair. I will not be looking to fly with them again any time soon if this trend continues!,0
Outbound YYZ-DUB TS 430 13/04. Return DUB-YYZ TS 431 21/04. Competitive comfortable economy on transatlantic flights. Few complaints. Direct non stop flights to UK and Ireland is a big bonus on convenience and on time travel.,1
My family and I were flying from the US to Kenya via Addis Ababa. The layover in Addis Ababa was terrible: long lines through security; long lines waiting for our tickets to be printed crowded poor communication for travelers that were waiting for connection flights and generally poor technical service. Long story short we almost missed our flight. The aircraft was literally waiting for us to board. Our tickets had not been printed out. One of the airline ticket collector had to leave their post and quickly write out our names on sheets of ticket paper. Other than that the aircraft ride was good. Shaky worn out seats but relatively comfortable. We had been given the front-most seats closest to the exit. The best part of it all was the food! Honestly I felt that going through all that hassle and to get to eat what the kind and demure hostesses gave us was worth it. Well cooked unfrozen good filling tasty organic food!,1
"Flight cancelled due to mechanical issues. Passengers waited on plane an hour, then deboarded and were not told anything about the flight for another hour when told it was cancelled. Told something would show up in email. At the time no alternative flight. Later that night after alternative plans and an email appeared that told of a replacement flight the next afternoon. Most had made alternative arrangements since Allegiant did not usually fly on Saturday from Indianapolis. Told to call customer service for refund. Hold time greater than two hours. Took a full day of multiple attempts to get through. Very poor effort at informing consumers, very poor customer service. Will not fly again, saving $30 is not worth 2 days of hassle.",0
Frankfurt-Lima and La Paz-Lima-Frankfurt. For the first flight everything went smoothly but for the return flight we were subjected to constant time schedule changes and we did not get the connecting flight to Madrid at Lima which had been advanced by one hour without information. We were charged more than 5000 USD as penalty for extra-tickets in Economy class to Frankfurt. The tickets had hardly been issued when the time schedule was again changed and the connecting flight Madrid-Frankfurt was not guaranteed anymore. We had to spend a night at the airport and to board Iberia flights to get back to Europe. Again employees tried their best to find a solution and cared for my son who was sick. However LAN does not seem reliable with no customer service available outside Chile to try and solve such problems.,0
Took a short trip from IAD to JFK. Good seats spacious legroom good entertainment including a small snack and a drink for a short flight. Courteous staff. In the future jetBlue will always be the first choice for domestic travel in the US. The jetBlue terminal at JFK was nicely done.,1
Took Sunwing to Cuba March 21 and returned March 28. Was a little worried because of all the bad reviews I read before hand but I was pleasantly surprised. Flight was on time had good food and champagne on the way there took the VIP on the way back which was worth the 25 extra dollars got to sit in an air conditioning room with free drinks and food. All in all had a good experience and I will fly with them again.,1
Rio-Lisbon-London 25th July 2014 22.35. Flight delayed until 26th July at 05.20. No explanation given other than the incoming flight from Lisbon was delayed! Put up in local airport hotel but forced to leave hotel at 2am to check in. Checking in at the hotel for a 4 hour stay took ages as each customer had to fill in a form. Not acceptable in any way and no TAP rep to help. Old plane from Rio worst legroom on long haul ever experienced and food (chicken?) was very dried out. IFE ancient. Most screens on a 10 hour flight did not work and those that did showed rolling programme of a few channels for which there was no info. At check-in at Rio we had been allocated a rearranged flight for Lisbon departure of 18.50 which was impossible to make and quite predictably the gates for this flight had closed as we arrived at Lisbon. No other flight was available until 10.10 the following morning. Another airport hotel which was reasonable. TAP insisted on 7am pickup. Queued at TAP customer services at 7.30 am to get a voucher for breakfast which at first they very strongly and rudely refused. We were told that we would get a sandwich on the plane to London at 11am. After a very heated discussion a voucher was grudgingly given for 6 Euros! At no stage did we find any of the TAP staff at all apologetic. This was clearly a common experience. We eventually reached home 48 hours after leaving our Rio hotel. We will never use TAP again.,0
SEA-LAX in Y on an A319. Good inflight service from the crew and an early arrival into LAX. Inflight safety video certainly got our attention.,1
From Milan MXP to Luxor Cairo on June 11. Positively impressed by this italian airline. Clean aircraft good seating in a 737-400 and very elegant and friendly FA. Flight on time and although it was a charter flight snacks and drinks were served.,0
Sitting in airport at this moment flight from Honolulu was late. Fine but flight plan allowed for time to be made up and arrived with time to connect onto original flight. Nope not an option. Even though they knew that anyone connecting to spots like Saskatoon would have to sit all day and not arrive home until 9pm - no attempt to hold the plane for the 5 mins it would of taken to get on that flight. These are being offered as flights for holidays and its not reasonable for you to start a flight at 7.30 pm (3 hours prior) and not get home for 26.5 hours later. I would of assumed that arrangements would of been made to make sure passengers could get connections.,0
I had an Air France ticket from Paris CDG to Melbourne. The second leg of the flight from Guangzhou to Melbourne was operated by China Southern. There were no personal television screens only shared screens which screened movies with illegible English subtitles. The lack of in-flight entertainment made this 9.5 hour flight dull and unpleasant. The food was the worst I have had on an airline: for dinner I chose noodles with beef the beef was a couple of tiny pieces of mince. My partner chose the chicken with rice and although the rice had a nice flavour there was hardly any chicken. The only decent meal on the flight was the omelette and hash brown which I chose for breakfast. The seats were also of a very poor standard. The headrests did not contain the function which allows you to push two flaps inwards in order to stop your head from lolling about when you fall asleep. I have had these adjustable headrests on other economy-class flights including the flight with Air France from Paris to Guangzhou and flights with Etihad Airways and Qantas. In addition the armrests between the seats could not be pushed all the way upwards and consequently my partner and I were unable to lean on each other without hitting our faces on the protruding armrest. The absence of personal in-flight entertainment and the extremely poor quality of the food and the seats compared with other economy-class flights means I won't be flying with China Southern again.,0
"Besides the mistakes made at the counter in Costa Rica, which was where I was coming from, the fact that they wanted to bump off people from the flight because they were overbooked and that the stewards knew little English though they were flying to an English speaking country, I had to endure one of the stewards throwing paper at me while I was exiting the plane. This is what led to it. I requested a gluten free diet weeks before my flight and received one on the flight to Panama (which was really a fruit plate). However, I was trying to explain to the male steward on flight heading into Port of Spain on 18th July 2015 that I was going to take a regular meal since I had not eaten in a long time. He just grew frustrated, maybe because he did not speak or understand English well, became angry and kept pointing to a paper saying that he had no name. I calmly said ok and accepted whatever was given - which I could not eat. I fell asleep not even knowing when my tray was taken away. As the plane landed I gave my 'Thank you' to the stewards as I passed. I noticed the male steward stopped speaking to his female coworker and glared at me. As I walked ahead a rolled up piece of paper was thrown in my path.  I don't know if it was just carelessly and mindlessly thrown and was disrespectful to me. Such a pity that this is the only airline that flies to Central America.",0
This is the first time I have flown on Spirit. The price published if very deceiving. It listed airfare round- trip from LAX to LAS as $152. By the time I pre-paid for one bag selected by seat (purchasing the least expensive) the total cost was well over $220. It cost more to carry-on one bag than it did to check it. The seats are so cramped that even a 10-year old would be uncomfortable. The seats on the plane do not recline. Had issues at the counter even though I did an early check-in. The weight limit for baggage is less than other airlines (40lbs vs 50lbs). I needed to delay my return flight and the additional cost to delay it by one week was $130 even though I had already prepaid for the baggage and seat but only $56 to purchase another one way ticket. Of course the baggage and seat cost would raise it to $100. What a rip-off! I have purchased a ticket on another airline and will forfeit my return ticket because I will never fly Spirit again!,0
Flight AF0503 and AF0508 13-19 Feb. CAI to CDG departure and arrival on time friendly crew clean aircraft but the food was not nice at all.,1
Without doubt the worst airline I have had the misfortune of flying with. I have recently had a fantastic holiday in Mexico the only downside was the flights. Outbound I managed to pay for the premium seats no problem with these comfortable and roomy but homeward bound only extra legroom seats were available.No problem with the legroom but the seats are ridiculously small and narrow. I can only compare the width to that of a child's car seat. Uncomfortable hard and so narrow that to get comfortable is impossible. It would appear that Thomas Cook have tried to cram in as many seats as possible and ignored the comfort of its passengers. On a long haul flight of 10 hours it can only be right that you would expect a degree of comfort but with Thomas Cook forget it. I and I would expect others would willingly pay a little more especially on long haul flights just to not be crippled by the time the flight is over. Virgin and several other airlines have got it right and I for one will never fly with this cattle herding shower again.,0
I had flights Paris-Montreal-Paris. This is the worst experience in my 14 years of travelling. The leg room and general scope of the seating is just awful and unacceptable. The plane is B777 with new seating capacity 3x4x3 instead of 3x3x3 (previous configuration) with a new black cover. The seats are so narrow that it is impossible to move even fingers. It is so annoying that the trip becomes nightmare. Air Canada has introduced these seats into three B777. I hope that they will re-consider these inhuman upgrades. The food as usually is not eatable. Staff was excellent. Not recommended for Paris-Montreal route.,0
"Arrived at airport and saw huge queues for check in. Approached by staff member and asked if we would like extra legroom seats at extra cost of Â£26.95 each. Said ""yes"" and were taken straight to a desk reserved for premium flyers and were then told we would get complimentary upgrades coming back. Cabin crew very pleasant and efficient. Monarch if a sort of hybrid airline between low cost and full service models. They have both charter and scheduled operations. 20kg baggage pus 10kg hand luggage included but all food and drinks are paid for as required. Both flights on time and as this was a four and a half hour flight the extra legroom seats were well worth the money. On board they announced spare extra legroom seats for sale at Â£30 one way so we were doubly pleased.",1
Gatwick - Grenoble on an Airbus A330 was a very pleasant experience no doubt assisted by the fact that we upgraded to extra leg room seats for a very modest Â£15. Unfortunately Monarch switched the aircraft for the inbound journey to one of their ageing Airbus A300's and the experience was much less enjoyable. They squeeze 9 seats across (the aircraft is only designed for 8) and somehow cram in approx 350 passengers no doubt aided by the non existent leg room. The seats also only support you up to around the upper back so you cant rest your head at all. Unless you're relatively small or thin you're in for a very uncomfortable flight. There was also an extremely annoying shrill noise which whined constantly both on the ground and in the air. The Cabin crew seemed resigned to the fact that they have their work cut out trying to placate passengers' grievances on these aircraft. It's high time Monarch retired these A300's and replaced them with something newer and more comfortable.,0
I have traveled around the world and back used many airlines in the process. The flight I took on March 9th with 2 other friends was the worst. We all took what would be acceptable as carryon's. Not realizing that the size you consider as a carryon is a lunch box. Arriving at the security gate the person there told my other 2 travelers that both their bags were not considered carry-on's and had to go to the desk to pay for them. That same lady told me that mine was acceptable to carry on the plane. I waited for them and they were told that if I had purchased the carry-on bag online the fee would have been $30.00. Not doing that they were charged $45.00. When I arrived at the gate to board I was stopped and told I had to pay for my bag. After telling them of my experience at the security gate they were quite rude and didn't care. Now because I didn't pay on-line or at the security gate I was told the fee was $100. Again insane for a duffle bag that could actually fit under my seat! We not only paid $190 more for luggage going but we paid online another $90 coming back. We went from Fort Lauderdale to Las Vegas and back for a total of $1003.00 for 3 of us. I could have gone US Airways for under $900. The plane was uncomfortable very cramped and dirty. They even charge you $2.00 for a cup of coffee anyone who flies knows how small that cup of coffee is. We did get the water for free after we made a fuss about it.,0
We flew Feb 21-28 and had great service with Sunwing. Ott-Cancun. Flights were 1 hr delayed both ways but everything was well organized and smooth.,1
On a flight to to Eindhoven from Dublin on 27/6/2014 the plane pushed back from the terminal and 5 mins later we were informed of a technical problem. We returned to the stand whilst the fault was investigated. Eventually we were told that the problem could not be fixed and another aircraft was being prepared. We eventually got on our way about 2.5 hours late. On the return journey on 30/6/2014 exactly the same thing happened. The plane pushed back and then we were informed of technical problems. We returned to the stand and the fault was investigated. After about an hour we were told that the problem was solved and we got on our way. On the first flight we were told we could not use the toilets whilst waiting for the fault to be found. After numerous complaints the staff gave in and allowed us to use the toilet at the rear of the aircraft.,0
Gold Coast to Bangkok via Singapore using Scoot Thru Purchased upgrade at check in for $179 to business class was told luggage was checked right through to final destination being Bangkok. Arrive Changi Connect transfer desk to receive boarding pass to Bangkok told that Gold Coast would not have checked luggage in and if I wanted to travel I would have to pay $55 as luggage was in a transfer container. Explained whole story they admitted their mistake but didn't care $55 or no travel. Seats in business Very hard and recline at odd angle making sleep impossible economy much much worse stick to Air Asia much better product!,0
HKG-BKK-HKG. Being in high season for Chinese new year this was one of the few biz class I could still book at short notice first time flying with them and feeling hesitant about the next time given the less than satisfactory experience. Boarding in HKG and BKK was good and orderly. The leather seat was impressive enough. Rather comfortable but angle-lie flat (i.e. feeling like sliding down) makes you think twice about flying anything longer than 5 hours with them. Service was fine friendly and efficient enough. However flying at 9pm from HKG to BKK. I was only served 3 mini open sandwiches instead of a dinner first time feeling hungry after a biz class flight! No fast track immigration card available when reaching BKK this was very disappointing. Return flight fared better but when I stepped on board they were too busy doing other chores hence no greetings! Finally was served a full lunch which was of good quality. Other than that the IFE was ok although choices a bit limited. What I most disliked was to see some of their off-duty staff (not in uniforms) occupying biz class seats. Luggage in HKG arrived last even thought marked priority bags.,0
I am disappointed with the service provided from Bahrain to Dublin. There is never enough time to catch the connecting flight in Abu Dhabi and most of the time it results in the bags not making it on the same flight. I was unlucky last week to have to wait in Dublin to collect bags that never made the connecting flight. I will not fly Etihad again by choice and would not recommend.,0
"Vancouver to Toronto, AC 132 and Toronto to Baltimore, AC 7936. 6/5/15. We just returned from a wonderful trip to Alaska. We flew Alaska Air there and returned on Air Canada flights. Big mistake! We booked last October and had confirmed reservations. From the moment we arrived at the airport, there were problems. First, their carry-on size is smaller than other airlines. OK. We repacked and paid for an extra checked bag. Then we proceeded to get our boarding passes only to find out we were on standby. No reasonable explanation offered. We proceeded to the gate where I stood ready to be first on line. The gate agent was patronizing and condescending, at best. He finally told me it was my fault since I did not select seats when I booked (the system said I could not select seats and would have to get them later.) I have travelled the world over for business - I am not a rookie at this. We waited and did get seats. Then they asked people to check their carry-on bags for free since the flight was full. We did it and were assured we were checked through to our final destination. Our first leg is completed - comfortable seats and good food options on board. Upon arrival in Toronto, we had to clear customs. We do all we are required to do, but we are not cleared to proceed because our bags have not been accounted for. We wait and are in fear of missing our next flight. Air Canada stamps our card so we can proceed. We run for the gate only to find the plane is not even there. We finally board and get to our final destination late. We wait for our bags and one is missing. No one from Air Canada is to be found and their phone system is very slow. We finally get through and are told the system is down and they can go nothing to track our bag. We did get our bag. The experience from start to finish was unpleasant and there were no apologies offered.",0
Seoul to San Francisco on 777 aircraft. Almost everything from check-in to landing was excellent. My baggage was tagged as priority due to the rather tight connection. My only criticism would be that the quality of food was not what I remembered it to be as well as it being redundant with the tiring ssambbap and steak option. Overall Asiana is still great value for money and my loyalty remains.,1
"Short haul very basic, but excellent staff. Transfer in Frankfurt is quite a hassle, long distances to be walked. Crew on long haul flight were okay. Smiling seems an issue, but service is quick. Seating is pretty okay, both legs on refurbished A340-300 which is a really nice long haul aircraft, quiet and spacious. Quality of food more than decent. Drinks assortment not so good. All in all, good flights for a good price.",1
LH 426 FRA to Philadelphia Tues 16th 1pm but changed to LH432 to Chicago at 5.10pm 16th. American connecting flight number to Philadelphia (arriving 1.15am today). Flight from Frankfurt to Philadelphia cancelled and rebooked on a later flight arriving almost half a day later. These things happen but the systematic rudeness and lack of consideration of the staff made matters worse. I've often found Lufthansa staff are among the most lacking in consideration of any airline.,0
Ottawa to Varadero Cuba and return. Both flights were delayed. Ottawa to Varadero was supposed to leave at 5.15pm Saturday delayed until 6am Sunday. Received notice that it was only supposed to be delayed until 3.50am Sunday. Had to wait 6 hours at the airport. No clear explanation given as to why there was a delay. Same thing leaving Varadero except no notice. Flight scheduled to leave at 10.15pm Saturday flight delayed until 12 pm Sunday - 13+ hour delay. No announcements no explanation as to the delay. We had to go through customs in Cuba twice because of leaving to go to the hotel they provided. They were so disorganized by the time we got checked in we only had 3 hours of sleep. We arrived back in Ottawa at about 4pm.,0
Overall satisfied with icelandair but writing this review as a heads up to other travelers. When our flight departed Seattle on Dec 30 I did not check in online and we received our picked seats without problems. This was our 40th anniversary trip. On the return flight we arrived at a nearly empty airport 3 hours before our departure and checked in. We were now seated in middle seats separated in the back of the plane. The flight was full and no way were they changing our seat. So moral of the story be sure to check in online 24 hours prior to departure. It seems like all flights depart from Iceland between 1630 and 1730 so it makes for a very hectic airport with few places to sit and wait. I also recommend bringing your lunch on board if it is a long flight.,1
Flew to Faro from Gatwick on first day of school half-term. Had booked extra leg-room seats but the type of plane was changed at the last minute and these were not available. Had pre-booked 6 seats together but we were arbitrarily split up on the new plane. On arrival at the gate the staff decided that no hand luggage with wheels (previously accepted at check-in without comment) could be put on the aircraft and chaos reigned as passengers tried to take out what they needed on the plane and find somewhere else to put it and then queue up again to check them in. We got on the plane at 6am for a scheduled 6.10am departure and then sat on the tarmac until the plane finally took off at 8.25am. Plane was full of children and babies so the delay was not appreciated. No reason given for this delay. The usual platitude announcements were made but even direct questions put to the chief steward showed that he had no idea of the reason for the delay or when we would depart. From ground crew on the plane it would appear to have been due to the incredibly long time it took the engineer to complete his paperwork. None of this should have been necessary but it appears that the change of plane completely blindsided the Monarch Airlines staff who did not foresee and pre-empt the problems that arose as a result.,0
"CX841 from New York JFK to HKG. Flight used a fairly new 777-300ER. There was priority boarding for first business premium economy then the passengers at the rear rows of the economy class cabin. Because of my seat being at the very rear of the cabin seat 67A I was able to board earlier than some. Cabin Crew were very friendly and responsive. The food was pretty good I had the fish option which consisted of Baked Salmon with black pepper sauce lima beans and carrots and spinach mashed potatoes. On the side was a warm bun with butter and a chicken salad. There was also a haagen-dazz ice cream for dessert. As this was a 16 hour flight we were offered a second meal in which I got the chicken with rice option that came with a peach yoghurt cake topped with honey toasted oatmeal a fruit salad and once again a warm bun with butter. The seats were fairly comfortable and I was very thankful not to be on a flight with the old fixed shell seats. The AVOD at my seat was horrible. It would not respond to my touch at all or would take more than 5 minutes. I alerted the cabin crew they told me that I had to take it slow. After showing them that it didn't work they went back to the galley apparently ""reset"" the AVOD and told me to try again. They ignored me after that. A tip for all you others out there traveling on long distance flights on the 777-300ERs. At the rear galley there is a snack tray or bin with peanuts chips and other goodies if you feel hungry between meals.",1
A330-300 from Amsterdam and return (GA 88-89 respectively). The flight had a short transit in AUH which for me was pretty cumbersome and tiring to get out of the plane after several hours in the aircraft. Fortunately the service was great the selection of meals were unique as they combined western and Indonesian menu. The cabin crew were responsive and professional in a way of treating and comforting passengers but the entertainment system was pretty disappointing. The movies were limited and the touch screen was not really responsive. I really wish to fly their brand new B777-300ER soon when they launch direct flight from CGK-AMS.,1
"San Jose (SJO) / Madrid in May. San Jose airport lounge by third company was standard. A new flat seat with a huge PTV screen was very comfortable. Business class passengers got 4MB internet coupon. Flight internet worked well. Meals were fine, however, the quality of appetizer was down compared with a few years ago. Wine selection was great as always.  Crews were kind and friendly. After arrival at Madrid, no gate was ready and we had to park on the open spot. No bus or passenger step ladder. We had to wait for them more than 10 min after the belt sign was off",1
I have flown Air Tahiti Nui several times. I always fly First Class. The level of service on the 2 flights I took on this trip has diminished. The amenity kits are not the same. On the flight LAX to PPT I was given an appetizer that was a joke. A small piece of shrimp with some sauce and 2 pieces of cheese. This is not First Class Service I was used to with Air Tahiti Nui previously. The boarding process is nerve racking. I resent having to go boxed in the buses that transport you to the aircraft. They box you in like sardines. I pay nearly $5000.00 for a one way flight to PPT and get the same boarding treatment was a coach paying passenger.,1
We had a connecting flight this morning from Paris to Amsterdam and then back to South Africa. Amsterdam flight delayed meaning we missed our flight to JNB. Told to go to customer service desk it was 40 min before we were helped. Flight changed to depart Paris direct to JNB 14 hours later. This took 40 min just to book new tickets the best we were offered was an economy food ticket no lounge no day room. It was our problem and nobody was going to help us. We went to the lounge and paid for a day pass. I fly on regular basis to Europe and have never been treated like this by any other airline. Our flight to Paris from Amsterdam coming on holiday was also delayed by 2 hours.,0
Tianjin to Shanghai Hongqi. The flight and service itself was comparable to an Australian domestic flight but what really impressed me was the effort and communication provided by the Captain given the excessive delays that appear to be common place around Beijing airspace.,1
GIG-LHR B773 Newly refurbished cabin. Seats were good and comfortable food was reasonable and entertainment was great HD screen with many options.,1
My husband and I flew SpiceJet and I must say it was an overall bad experience. Flight was booked for 10.30 am and at first the flight was delayed to 12.20 pm after which I received a call stating the flight had been further delayed to 1.50pm. I fail to understand why there was a 3.5 hour delay. The staff at the counters did not offer any solution apart from the manager whom we contacted at the end.,0
ICN-PVG. Check-in and boarding quick. Staff were efficient but unfriendly - some looked glum and didn't seem to want to assist passengers. Tasty meal served promptly after take-off. Announcements made in Chinese English and Korean. Got a free copy of China Daily on request. Appeared to be headphone facilities but weren't given any headsets. No personal TV but newspaper kept me entertained for the short flight. Adequate leg room. Overall considering the cost it does the job but otherwise don't expect too much.,1
"Very disappointed, arrived at airport at 6am for a 8am flight with a family of 9ppl only to find out that the plane was delayed till 10am and didn't actually leave till 11am, not pleasant when traveling with children. Our little one got sick on the flight and there were no bags, it looked like the plane had not even been properly cleaned before our delayed flight. I would also think that after having people waiting such a long period of time that they would offer something other than a beverage on the plane, they didn't even seem to have coffee for the travelers when the flight finally left. A very disappointing and stressful travel day.",0
Boston to London. As this was a gift we flew business class and paid the full amount. While new to the Virgin style I found the set up a bit confusing. The flight attendants actually had to make people's beds as it was impossible to figure out how to do it yourself. On the way back from London I had ordered a starter main course and dessert when requested at the beginning of the flight. When the dessert time came the flight attendant said there was no more left of what I had ordered. The dessert itself is irrelevant but the fact that they ran out of anything for people paying thousands of dollars for this service was enough to make me angry.,0
Second time I have used US airways and both times have been a disaster. First time from Tucson to Sacramento was delayed in Tucson (no explanation) then when I did get on and had to transfer planes in Phoenix I waited 3 hrs with a boarding pass in front of the gate. When I presented my boarding pass at the gate to get on they told me that the seat was already taken. Spent the night in Phoenix at a hotel because no flights were available. Swore I wouldn't fly them again but I had to get to Columbus Ohio for a wedding - got on the plane on time then sat there when they announced (at least they told us this time) that there were mechanical difficulties. Everyone got off got in a line of at least 100 fellow travelers to rebook it and the best they could do was another flight 10.5h later to arrive the next day (wedding would have already happened). Got my money back at least.,0
"Cardiff-CDG operated by Flybe but sold on Air France's website. I bought a return ticket when sold on their website it should provide a full fee paying airline's service. On the 1st leg CDG-CDW I got a ""food and snack voucher"" which allowed me to transform flybe into a ""normal airline"". On the way back I was greeted with utter rudeness at CDW from Flybe staff and told that this was a pure flybe flight and to take a hike for the ""food and drink"" voucher. Complained to their codeshare partner and got 3000 miles from Air France for the mess from flybe. Flybe staff need to learn manners and what it it entails to have a ""codeshare"" flight! Never again with them even via codeshare! I'd rather drive from LHR to Cardiff!",0
The third time I used Kuwait Airways to travel from New York to Mumbai. I had a very poor experience. I had a flight change in Kuwait. On both flights my seat would not work and I had to sit upright for the entire trip. To make things worse the TV did not work either. I would not recommend this airline if you have other options.,0
I flew from Hagerstown to Sanford and back five days apart. I found everyone in both terminals to be very cordial. The boarding agent in Hagerstown was actually humorous and made the wait seem shorter. The flight attendants were not exactly warm but they were nevertheless efficient. Both flights left and arrived on time. I have read complaints about luggage fees but I think the website is quite clear so I decided to travel light. I had a small bag as my one small free carry-on item and I thought that I might have to pay a fee for the dozen roses in my other hand but there was no extra charge. No problems on my first flight using Allegiant. I'll do it again.,1
Returned to Toronto on April 10 from Puerto Vallarta. Seats didn't recline. Inflight movie available to only half the plane. Plane was so old it still had ashtrays! Seats were terribly uncomfortable. Washrooms smelt to high heaven. Inflight meal was so inedible that most people didn't eat it. As a matter of fact the stewards were trying to give away seconds! I will never fly with this airline again.,0
Round-trip Toronto to Dallas Sep 29 - 30. New A319 on both segments - aircraft clean and shiny. Paid for premium seat and well worth the $80 for the round trip. Lots of leg room exit row on return segment. AVOD and AC power available to all seats. Perhaps it's the new hardware making everyone happier - cabin crew was polite and friendly on both legs in contrast to several other AA flights in recent years.,1
Lufthansa flight LH763 from Delhi to Munich October 4th 2014. Out-dated and worn business class seats. Possible to recline fully but narrow. Really close to non-existent service. Despite few passengers in business class very slow and inattentive service. After initial take-off beverages no more drink service of water or anything else. Food quality like in a cheap charter flight. No one of the staff bothered to serve a quick breakfast to those passengers who wanted to sleep a bit longer not even a cup of coffee.,0
20 June 2014. Was booked on flight KOD72G Denver to Chicago for business. Like all my previous experiences flying on United not only does the flight board beyond the stated time we pull out of the gate 40 minutes late only to be told while sitting on the runway that we are going to be held 30 minutes in our position. It's bad enough that the seats are extremely small now we're delayed over 1 hour total which causes issues with our connections. These constant delays and poor service from the airline is unacceptable.,0
Flew on QF94 from LAX-MEL. The flight was delayed by an hour due to a connecting flight with most of the passengers being late. We pushed back to find there was an issue with a gauge on the aircraft and waited on the tarmac for another hour. The captain and crew kept everyone informed very well. The cabin crew were extremely friendly prompt and professional on the flight. The economy seat is not that comfortable for a 15 hour flight and I found myself walking around a lot more than I should because of that. Food was good for economy as well. Overall a very good flight.,1
Birmingham to Fuertventura. Plane left on time 8.15am and arrived on time. Birmingham airport is well organised and checking in was simple and quick. The planes are short on leg room and not the most comfortable for a 4 hour flight. The service on board was efficient and the cabin staff were friendly. The problem was at the destination. We had booked for transfers to our hotel and we had to wait over 2 hours for the bus. We contacted the Cosmos Rep and also the people in the airport who were organising the transfers. They smiled and said it will be here in a minute. It would have been cheaper and quicker to have caught the local public service bus.,1
Singapore-Kota Kinabalu return economy class. Very pleasant and punctual flights with decent meals extremely helpful flight attendants and a cheerful cabin. The service was exceptionally good for a short two-hour flight. I actually felt like an appreciated customer on this airline! Unfortunately this is not the norm these days but it should be..,1
WDH-TXL. Flight attendants could be friendlier. Once in Berlin transit security staff in Berlin took me too late to the gate and I stood on the bridge and watched in dismay as my LHR connecting flight departed without me and my young daughter while security staff were busy talking on the ground next to my bumped luggage. 2 hours later security staff demanded USD2000 from me to rebook my missed flights via LHR to Chicago claiming that this was because I had no airport transit visa. When I explained that there was a fax from BA about my arrival and connecting flight and the tardiness of the security staff I was rebooked without charge but no apology. Air Berlin told me that they were not British Airways although the flight showed their name and number as well yet they simply cancelled my Chicago-Des Moines confirmed reservation on American Airlines without explanation. This is extremely poor service from a OneWorld partner.,0
First time Air Transat and I was pleased. The option+ for extra leg room food 1 small bottle of sparkling wine a headset and a blanket sheet is worth it for $60 and you know where you will be seated. A330 great plane.,1
Business class CX135 HK to Melbourne 13 May 2015. We were coming off a 6 hour stopover from London and having spent the time in their Wings lounge. Good amenities and a great shower. The food and drinks selection was great. Tried an Asian soup from the Noodle bar and was nice. Boarding was a breeze and once on board the pampering begun. We had seats 20 D & G in the centre in the smaller rear cabin. Quiet and no through traffic. The service was excellent and the food and wine selection was just as good. Only a 9 hour flight so a quick movie and a few hours of sleep and its another excellent breakfast. One small issue was the head female attendant was very heavy handed on the perfume and I think that in a confined space like a plane very little or no perfume should be worn by staff or passengers as it can really effect people around you. Overall very happy with Cathay Pacific product and would fly with them again.,1
Washington Dulles via Amsterdam to Nairobi. The service was very competent and friendly. We had a mechanical problem with the aircraft from AMS-NBO which caused a significant delay. KLM did an excellent job communicating with passengers finding a new plane and calling in a new crew. Fortunately I was able to use the lounge but had friends in economy and they were all pleased with the service.,1
I have just returned from a holiday to Las Vegas which went from Glasgow & stopped in Philly. I wanted to write a review as I read others before I left and they were mostly all really bad so I was terrified about what to expect. I'm pleased to say I was more than pleasantly surprised by my travel experience. All flights left on time and were early arriving we actually got back into Glasgow 45 minutes earlier than expected! Staff were pleasant the flight was smooth and there was plenty of room in our seats. Even the food was good it was free on the transatlantic flight and we just bought our own snacks for the domestic flight however all flights had complimentary drinks which was more than I expected on the domestic ones. I have to say it's a shame for those that have had a bad experience but I want people to know that it doesn't always have to be bad.,1
Flew ATH-ZRH before connecting with Lufthansa. The aircraft was an Airbus A321. The cabin crew were very friendly their products were good. I can't say much about the entertainment. Drop down screens were describing Switzerland and showing the location of the flight (quite interesting to watch for a bit). I was pretty happy with them once I landed.,1
LS888 on 29th March. On the return leg of a weekend in Prague back to Manchester after having a significant delay on the way out we feared the worst but the plane was only marginally delayed setting off and then only slightly further delayed by strong head winds. The plane was 16 years old but had only been brought by Jet2 in January of this year so was smart and clean on the inside though I found the seats fairly narrow and uncomfortable. We felt the cabin crew were unprofessional they gossiped openly in front of us about how they had all been out until 5am that morning partying. They carried out the safety briefing with a look of extreme boredom in the end. Throughout the flight they spoke on the internal phone and every time they replaced it they slammed it with great force making a huge bang which after numerous occasions was very wearing. I felt the noisy announcements and attempts to sell were misplaced on an evening flight. Other than that the flight was okay but as usual Jet2 sold out of sandwiches and toasties. Plus we only had euros to hand and the exchange rate was daylight robbery. Two hot drinks and one Twix converted at 9 euros. Ouch. Unfortunately our English money was in the hand luggage which was of course nowhere near our seats. A man a couple of rows back from us was allowed to board the plane with four separate pieces of hand luggage filling an entire overhead bin. Why Jet2 cannot be stricter about hand luggage sizes and number of pieces I cannot understand. Towards the end of boarding all hand luggage had to be checked as so little space was left. Frankly it was all a bit shambolic and like the attitude of the cabin crew did not instil any confidence.,0
Dubai to Vienna / Boeing 767 in new business class. Seats are comfortable with enough privacy. Maybe for some travellers a bit narrow as the armrests and consoles are quite high. Cabin staff was ok - could have been friendlier. Food was a midnight snack (had chicken tikka) which was ok. Breakfast was eggs with toast yoghurt and fruit. Was very good and freshly cooked by the chef on board. Cabin was clean. Toilets without amenities (no hand lotion or eau de toilette). Lounge service in Dubai ok with good choice of food (hot and cold). Overall good experience but crew could have done more to make it memorable.,0
LHR-ZRH return on A320. Both flights on time. Leg room good. Sandwich and drinks out ice cream and beer on return and a Swiss chocolate.,1
I often travel with Aer Lingus from Belfast City to Gatwick and have also flown to Portugal with them as well. The flights are always on time staff polite and very helpful. I'm not a fan of flying long or short journeys but I enjoy the experience with Aer Lingus.,1
Went to Cancun with Sunwing January 2014. When we got to the YEG airport I have never seen a longer queue to check in. Took almost an hour to check in which is the longest it's ever taken me. I have flown many times with other airlines and never has it taken that long. Once we got to the desk the lady working was not very helpful and was rude not a good start to our vacation. Wouldn't let us have a carry on because it was too big. Same carry on we use with other airlines and it's never been a problem. The service on the plane was good and they give you a glass of champagne once you take off which I thought was nice. The food was good as well. On the way back our plane had to stop for gas so that delayed things by an hour and a half which no one was impressed by delays are understandable when flying however. I hope they come up with a faster system if I choose to fly Sunwing again.,0
I fly internationally about 4-6 times a year on various airlines and my recent Icelandair flights from Boston to Saint Petersburg was one of the best. The plane was new comfortable and very clean. The blankets they offered were plush and cozy. The airline doesn't offered free meals for economy class but the options offered for purchase are restaurant grade at a negligible cost (the most expensive dish was about 10 euros). I tried oatmeal salad and mini hamburgers all of which were delicious. All of these made the flight experience more pleasant than having free airline food like other airlines. I also appreciated the on time departures which insured that I did not worry about missing my tight connections. The staff was extremely friendly and gracious and even covered me with a blanket when I fell asleep on a flight from Saint Petersburg to Keflavik. I highly recommend using this wonderful airline where small details make a big difference.,1
The business class seat on this 777-300ER flight from Taipei to San Francisco has a reverse herring bone layout which I've never flown in. Am not a fan of the traditional herringbone layout but a reverse formation is much better for you face into the window and do not see any other passengers since you're facing away from them. It nearly feels like you're sitting in a recliner chair facing a window with a moving view while drinking champagne. The downside is that it's difficult to get out of the seat if you're sleeping or reclining. Also if you really want to see what's happening outside you have to awkwardly bend towards the window to get closer to the view. The service is somewhat uncompetitive to the other Asian airlines. The branding is old and stale. The green colour of the livery looks too much like a shipping company - EVA Air is an affiliate of Evergreen Shipping Line - and the green of the uniforms looks overly utilitarian. I did enjoy the food menu except for the Wolfberry jelly and the IFE had a considerable amount of entertainment options. The crew also offered a pyjama on this 12 hour flight which is always a good idea. What impressed me though was the very unique Rimowa toiletry bag - shaped like a mini Rimowa suitcase.,1
Maybe I was expecting too much from a regional flight. I was on CX 716 from Singapore to Hong Kong on 14th July. The economy class seats were the notorious shell seats and it was extremely uncomfortable. There was no lumbar support and the seat back was really hard. There was also no foot rest. In addition amenity kits and menus were not given out to us. What's worse was that when we boarded the flight not every seat had blankets and pillows on them and they were only available upon request and the entire process of passengers settling down into their seats was extremely chaotic as several passengers started requesting blankets and pillows from the cabin crew during pushback and the cabin crew were hurrying back and forth just to hand them the blankets and pillows. The food portions were also pretty small and I was still famished even after the meal service. The cutlery provided was also made of cheap plastic and not metal unlike on some other airlines. We were also not served tea or coffee throughout the flight. The cabin crew were in a rush to collect the meal trays from the passengers and when the pilot came on the speaker and requested for the cabin crew to take their seats for landing they did not even conduct a safety check for us such as making sure our seat belts were fastened window shades were lifted and hand carry items were placed under the seat in front of us. The only positive on my outbound journey from Singapore to Tokyo was that the cabin crew were really friendly and were always smiling. My inbound journey on CX was much better. I'll post a review on it after this.,0
Alicante to Gatwick 11th October 2013. Hand baggage only and checked in on my iPhone the app was very easy to use. There was a little confusion at the gate about which queue was what (i.e. Speed Boarding and the Other Queue) however announcements were made to clarify the confusion. One bag policy was an irritation (as was their militant- style checks of it) given that Monarch have now relaxed this as long as both bags fit within the allowance. Very warm welcome onboard by the crew. Seating tight but not too uncomfortable for a short flight - wouldn't fly with them mid-haul in those seats however. Allocated seating is a great improvement although there is still a mad rush to board for locker space. A fear seems to exist on low cost carriers in regards to this but I don't find this same mad rush on BA flights (when passengers tend to carry even more hand luggage). Selection of food and drink very extensive. Not too many announcements and no pushy sales. Service very warm and friendly. On time arrival and quick disembarkation. If easyJet can get smooth out the last remaining 'low cost feel' ruffles from their product (issues with hand luggage and more options to pay extra for space i.e. a blocked middle seat) I would consider them on par with BA 's product in Europe. easyJet have come a long way and overall I was quite pleased with the journey experience.,1
Mixed business and economy between Manchester and Boston. Staff provided warm professional service - first rate. Experience from check-in to baggage claim was hassle free. Business class food was great - much better than expected. Seat was very comfortable. Really good value for money - certainly will fly with them again.,1
Flew Bangkok to Copenhagen on A340 recently. Granted A340s are relatively new the business class seats seem to age already. The position adjuster is hard to use and one can never adjust individual segments such as recline or leg-rest. Everything was linked. If one wants to recline the leg-rest retracts first so one must raise one's legs slightly first. Rather odd. Video selection is way too thin for a long haul flight. Compared to what Singapore or ANA are offering in the same class the seats seem antiquated. SAS also has the odd rule of not allowing blankets on or shoes off during take off and landing. So after a good snooze the cabin crew yanks the blanket off 30 minutes prior to landing. A rather rude way to wake up. I miss Air New Zealand which allows the same class full recline during landing.,1
"A memorable experience on A380-800 with Singapore Airlines. SQ861 on 27/6, delayed by around half an hour, but flight crew handled the flight efficiently. Window seat on the A380-800 was slightly wider, more comfortable than other ordinary seats. Cabin crew provided highly professional service throughout the journey and had frequent cabin presence. An incredible range of inflight movies including Asian and international films, with fairly large screens. Inflight meal was above average, though not impressive. Cabin temperature was too cold and more than half of the passengers had put their blankets on. In general, considering the high level of service quality offered, this flight had a good value for money.",1
Flew domestic Mehrabad - Mashhad - Mehrabad a few weeks ago. The lounge at THR is professional and maintained served and supplied with food and beverages. Food was served even in economy on a short flight and it was good according to time of the day. Service next to none really!,1
Our flight from CCU-BOM on 26th July 2012 was rescheduled just because there were not enough passengers on the flight we booked we had an international connecting from Mumbai so we left early and had to wait for 10 hours in Mumbai to catch our connection. Service on the flight and the service from ground staff was unprofessional.,0
9th Feb TK70. We purchased our tickets from London to Istanbul and then from Istanbul on to Hong Kong almost as soon as they were released 11 months before we were due to travel. Perhaps because we booked through an online travel agent we were not offered seat selection at that point. We didn't worry too much because we assumed that the airlines default position would be to sit a couple together and after all we had booked very early. This turned out to be a naive assumption! When we attempted to check in online which was more than 36 hours before the Istanbul to Hong Kong flight the only seats available were at opposite ends of the cabin. Our pleas to the Turkish airlines office in London the check in desk at Gatwick and the transfer desk at Istanbul were all to no avail. This completely ruined the flight for me whilst I respect that the airline couldn't bump someone from a pre booked seat we should have been sat together by default at point of booking.,0
CPH-DOH-SGN and back 4 flights in total. Good product consistency. Crew helpful and reacting quickly on all call bells by passengers within 1-2 minutes maximum. Bar and food service great. One could though wish there were more after dinner liqueurs apart from just brandy. Rest of bar service is very good with choice of 2 red and 2 white wines of good quality even free (and real) champagne in Economy impressive! CPH-DOH-CPH 787 Dreamliner seats narrow. DOH-SGN-DOH A330 and more comfortable. Bathrooms kept tidy at all times with lotion and eau de toilette. Current airport in DOH is a nightmare and destroys the whole superb inflight experience. All in all excellent!,1
"Stockholm Arlanda - LAX, flight DY7087, 30 July 2015: Our flight home to LAX, was chartered out to EuroAtlantic Airways. We were supposed to fly home on a Boeing 787, but instead were flown on a very old Boeing 777. This was by far my worst experience with a long-haul flight, and I travel internationally about once every 1-2 years. I will not fly Norwegian for a long-haul flight again in the future. I guess you get what you pay for. Problems during pre-flight check-in process: My seat was reassigned from 13D to 53A. I had paid extra in order to choose my seat when I booked, and so this reassignment to the back of the plane was not something I was happy about. At least my husband and I were reassigned to seats next to each other, which was not the case for some passengers. The pre-boarding process was chaos. All passengers were required to stay in a small holding area for more than 1.5 hours while waiting for announcements from staff. Boarding took about 45 minutes to begin. There was then no further boarding announcements, just a sudden chaotic surge of people toward the gate. No order of boarding by rows or early boarding was done. So the boarding process itself took at least another hour. By this time our flight takeoff was delayed 2.5 hours. Features of this aircraft which were very disappointing: Aircraft was dirty and smelt. Dust and food particles on seats, trash stuck in various places, including in the ashtrays in the armrests. The entertainment system was basically non-functional. After messing around with it we discovered it had about 4 analog stations showing 3 TV comedy programs in a continuous loop. Often there was so much static they were impossible to watch. The audio outlets appeared to be for the old 3-prong type earphones from the 1980s. Using my own headset only allowed sound in one ear. The gluten free menu I had ordered was delivered promptly. The flight attendants would not collect my trash for about 2.5 hours after it was served, even when I requested it to be collected. No climate control (air vents) for passengers. It was all centrally controlled, so either was too hot or too cold the whole flight. With my window seat, the window shades (closed) were very hot as we flew over Greenland and Canada. This made the flight even more uncomfortable. Very limited beverage choices, and provided infrequently. We had to go to the galley at the rear of the plane twice to request water. Positives about this flight: The seats had footrests, which helped a bit with my lower back pain. Relatively smooth flight once we finally took off. ",0
HKG-ORD on B777 in Business. Despite a 90 minute delay a wonderful flight. Peaceful cabin environment comfortable seat excellent IFE good food and crisp professional attentive service. Hard to find many faults other than a somewhat sub-standard wine list. Would recommend Cathay for long haul business which is significantly better than their regional business product reviewed previously.,1
LHR-SEZ-SEZ. Our family trip was without incident. Plane was pretty empty on the way out so plenty of space to move around. Fortunately our flight was the first schedule for the re- opening of air space due to the volcanic ash. Plane full to capacity as expected. Cabin crew very accommodating able to obtain refreshments at any time.,1
YUL-YVR-YUL both legs on a tired looking A330-300. I checked in online and had carry-on luggage only so did not have any interaction with the check-in staff. Used the Maple Leaf Lounge on the domestic side in Montreal which is in dire need of a facelift and expansion as it tends to get very crowded at peak hours. Boarding was smooth and both flights left the gate and arrived on time. The pods are showing their age with worn-out and scuffed sections. Cabin lighting was dim and did not facilitate an airy environment. On-board service was typical AC style with FA's doing the absolute minimum required of them. Food and beverage choices were OK but it is time for an upgraded menu as they have had the same choices on transcontinental flights in Business Class for the past 4 years. IFE had a reasonable selection of movies but the sound quality was not the best even with my own noise- cancelling headphones. Washrooms like the aircraft itself looked old and run-down leaving the passengers with the impression that they were dirty. Air Canada prides itself in being voted the best North American Airline for several years in a row which I believe is giving them a totally false sense of accomplishment by comparing them to US carriers which are widely acknowledged as being inferior to Middle Eastern and Asian carriers. Although AC has made some progress in recent years uplifting its image and improving its service its progress has now stalled which if left unattended will push them back into the same mediocrity as the US carriers. It is time for them to start setting the bar higher and striving for a higher standard of service by looking to full-service Asian and Middle Eastern carriers as examples to follow.,0
Free allocated seats? This is a joke of a company they try to get money for one way or the other. It's free only if you Check-in 7 days before but if your trip is more than 7 days then you will need either to pay for the Â£5/Â£ 10 for choosing your seat and print and tale the printed ticket with you or you will need to pray that you can find internet and a printer on your holiday destination. I will not recommend this company to anyone. Avoid like plague.,0
I am always surprised to see some comments. Passengers don't bother to look for things and then blame the airline! The Lisbon TAP lounge is before passport control so if you are connecting in Lisbon all you need is trying to find it! As a frequent flyer I always try and find things. It is not that difficult. Anyway I have flown them on several occasions and in short haul they are the almost only ones serving food and wine in economy! I don't think any Spanish carrier does that Air France gives you cookies or a croissant only! Just took TAP again on a Dakar- Brussels via Lisbon and trip was good.,1
Last week I flew from Gatwick to Gambia. I have travelled world-wide in Economy with other airlines for much longer periods of time and although being cramped I have never had a problem. I never recline my seat however this journey was made extremely uncomfortable not by the person in front of me but the woman behind. For the first few hours of the flight she had had her feet digging into my back. An hour before we were due to land she woke up and I heard her tutting and mumbling then quite violently she shoved my seat forward and held it there. I was in a window seat in row 17 and had previously had the full view of my window and a bit of the one behind. Now I had half of my own window which shows how far forward she had rammed my seat. In response she hurled abuse at me saying that I have been squashing her the entire 6.5 hours etc. I was also quite relieved that I had just finished my cup of hot coffee that I was holding only minutes before. This of course is not a fault of the airline. I do however believe that if they want to reduce the space of the seats then they should not have the seats be able to recline or be moved at all. The plane was old and shabby and not ideal for a flight that long. I have been on shorter flights in Monarch planes that looked a lot better than this one. On the return flight I was at the back of the plane and nowhere near the group but as we geared up ready for take off suddenly all the power went out and there were a lot of ashen-faced passengers who were no doubt thinking that had better not happen in the air. We were switched to auxiliary power and told by a very apologetic pilot that it would not happen again. I will not be flying with Monarch again.,0
I had about a 10 hr non stop flight from Paris to New York. There was no in seat TV. Only 2-3 TVs in the aisle and they asked for $5 each for headphones to listen to the movies they were playing of their choice. All the flight attendants were rude. I needed a blanket but they denied this. Overall it was a lesson for me to avoid American Airlines flights wherever possible.,0
London To Bangkok (economy) Feb 8th returning 22nd. Good staff at both ends booking in was efficient and seamless. The e-ticket is very helpful as you have no worries about loosing your boarding cards. The plane was clean and airy. The seats were soft and spacious leg room was not an issue for me (I am 6ft). The AVOD was crammed with good movies music and games. Staff well turned out helpful and they were always smiling. Drinks were available at all times with juice and water runs made regularly. My only issue was the food. I had chicken and rice on both legs and it was poor both times. The deserts were very good better then many other airlines I have flown with.,1
Etihad is a cheaper airline but these people will not be given frequent flyer credit to passengers. My American Airline FF number was printed on boarding pass for each segment but I have yet to receive miles. I have been in touch with American Airlines as well as Etihad on several occasions but to no avail (sent them copies of boarding passes). ,0
Would never fly with United Airlines again we boarded the plane back from Florida to Newark to fly on to the UK to be greeted by miserable crew. This continued the whole of the flight. Anything asked of them seemed too much trouble food was awful and was practically thrown at us. Seating was so uncomfortable cramped together but the worst part was as we were coming into land at Newark the pilot overshot the runway had to pull back up very fast and circle to try again it all happened so fast - it was so scary but not one of the crew checked on any of us passengers one lady got up to be sick in the toilet - all we had was a female cabin crew shouting for her to get out of the toilet and sit down. A child around 9 yrs of age was beside himself but still no one came to check on us. We got down safely the second time after being told they were moving to another runway. But even after the plane got down safely not one of the crew came to see if anyone needed any help. The passengers are supposed to come first but in this instance none of us were. Wouldnt recommend this airline to anyone and will never fly with them again.,0
Dub to Madrid. Late departure due to passengers trying to take over sized bags onboard. Gate crew did a professional job of trying to take bags from people who should have known better. An almost full flight handled professionally by a competent crew. Nice Hot Irish Breakfast from the Buy on Board menu and regular updates from Captain during the trip. A great mid way service in terms of getting what you pay for with the care from the crew equivalent to that of any full service airline.,1
Travelled on flight AC033 Vancouver to Sydney on October 31. Again staff were rude and unhelpful. Inflight entertainment did not work in our row of seats for entire flight - 16 hours is a long time to listen to aircraft noise and read a book. Seat belt sign again used to excess and it did mean that tea and coffee were never served as no hot beverages when seat belt sign is on. Staff kept one toilet for their own use by claiming it was 'out of order'. One member of staff was extremely rude and loud actually shouting instructions at passengers. Would not fly internationally with Air Canada again.,0
Flew EK725 from Dubai to Dar Es Salaam 19/5/15. I often fly this route after flying from New Zealand and always prefer this older 777 as it consistently has a great crew brilliant service and food/drink. Much more attentive than the huge long business class on the A380's where crew walk for miles to ferry food and drink. I only marked them down on the seat as it is an older one and same for the inflight entertainment otherwise I would rather fly these older planes than the 380's apart from the bar area of course.,1
"Just completed GMP-HND-GMP for the long Buddha's Birthday holiday in Korea. Despite many negative reviews of 787 seat space I was pleasantly surprised with the amount of legroom I had at 5'11"" and 250 lbs (180 cm 115 kg). I had enough space between my knees and the seat and could extend my legs full under the seat in front of me. I had both middle and window seats. The cabin felt spacious with its large windows and overhead bin design that created the feeling of high ceilings. The automatic ""no shade"" window shade buttons were very effective with 9am clear sunny skies. The AVOD was new and well designed and had a large selection of movies but the flight was short so there wasn't time to finish anything. ANA boards lightning fast. Our flight from HND-GMP boarded 15 minutes late but we still pushed back on time! Airplane food normally receives nothing but bad reviews but I was quite pleased with the meal service (under two hour flight so it was all on one tray). The vegetables fish and noodles all tasted fresh and were well arranged. The snack mix is the best. Crispy salty and crunchy! They also had unique drink offerings - Kabosu juice (sweet and tart) as well as their own black tea.",1
Madrid to Beijing via Moscow. I paid 457 euro with taxes included which was a great price. The plane going over was shabby looking inside with no IFE. The food was just ok and the cabin crew never even smiled once or were standing at the door with leaving the plane. I say over all they need to improve on customer service and update the planes a little.,0
Johannesburg to New York JFK direct flight. Airbus A340-600. Great plane and pilots. Seats not bad at all I sat at the row 45 emergency exit. Check in went quickly since we had already got our boarding passes with our connecting domestic flight check in. Ground staff were friendly. After take off we were served drinks then a nice dinner. Between dinner and breakfast the cabin crew offered refreshments at least 5 times. They stopped at nothing to rectify the few personal entertainment systems that was out of order even moving passengers to other seats. Smooth flight took off on time and arrived 45 minutes early.,1
Returning from Paphos airport was chaos huge queues. When finally reaching check in I was informed my bag was too soft and directed to the special bag queue. My bag has travelled with me for over 15 years and was never deemed too soft. The staff that were there were either rude or of no help.,0
Very surprised full meal was served for a short flight between Hong Kong to Taipei. Ordered low sodium meal and it was really good with steamed fish and vegetables. Service is attentive and pleasant with smiles. Very impressive highly recommend. One of the excellent airlines in the world.,1
FRA to YYZ. Business class pods were wonderful. We fly these several times a year. The new Maple Leaf Lounge at FRA was beautiful! The food was fresh and plentiful power outlets were readily available spacious and the showers were excellent. The lounge is right on top of the departure gate resulting in a easy process to board the plane. Flew a 777. Pods were clean FA's were attentive and pleasant bathrooms were clean food was excellent for an airline and flight was uneventful (the way it should be). I am *A Gold. Fly AC mostly and most flights are pretty boring. Flights arrive and depart on time. Only one time in the past 12 months did my flights get cancelled or delayed. In this single case Air Canada had me rebooked quickly.,1
Boarded Aeroflot in Amsterdam for flight to Moscow. Just prior to departing the gate there was a loud commotion in the rear of the plane - it seems we were traveling with a restrained reluctant prisoner. We checked in for our return flight in St. Petersburg for Amsterdam. We requested that we and our luggage be booked thru to Detroit. the attendant assured us that it was done. Upon arrival in Amsterdam we were informed by KLM that they did not receive confirmation of our flight from Amsterdam to Detroit and our seats had been resold. 10 hours later we were aboard a Delta flight on the way home. The issue was not in translation because our request had been relayed by our Russian Tour director and our luggage was booked thru to Detroit. Never again.,0
WX 300 Cardiff to Edinburgh. 18th May. Return 19th May WX 310. Travelled from Cardrff to Edinburgh and was hugely impressed by the service. The attendants were very helpful and happy and the complimentary drinks and snacks came in handy. Shame they're leaving Cardiff airport.,1
RNO-DEN-IAD-BWI-LAS-RNO. Good fares pleasant staff on-time for the most part and when a delay comes up we are informed. This trip held true to that again. But my only issue on this trip and it is not a fault but rather a comment. Flying cross country non-stop on a 737 for 5 hours is a bit brutal. We did get on a brand new 737-800 for the longest sector from BWI to LAS which was nice but still a very long trip on a small plane that was packed to the hilt. The crew were pleasant on all sectors. The ground staff at BWI were great and the Skycap had us laughing. All in all a good product with no complaints really. Just remember to buy a meal before you get on a long flight and if you don't mind a long flight on a small plane then Southwest is the way to go. Plus you can't beat the two free check-in bags.,1
I travelled from LHR-PER stopped over in KL on my return. Travelled on A380 the seats food service and comfort were incredible. The inflight entertainment had a good variety of films. Cabin crew were courteous and friendly. I only have praise for Malaysia Airlines.,1
Positives : Food quality. Recent efforts to renew the fleet. Crew friendliness Non-smoking restrictions (though I'm a smoker I consider this a plus) Negatives : Delays (too frequent). Transit lounge (poor comfort). Business & First Class lounge (poor comfort as compared to other airlines). Hygiene on board (dirty WCs sometimes even dirty seats). Inflight entertainment (non-existent). Seating allocation (non-existent). Algiers airport duty free shopping and facilities (poor standards). One of the most expensive airline for $ per distance.,0
From Kunming to Dakha and return a few days later. Flights slightly delayed. Airplane clean. Food inedible. Announcements in English not readable. No recognition of Gold Skyteam membership. Sometimes one can really not understand how they managed to become a member of Skyteam.,1
LHR-CAI Flight left London about 20 mins late but time was made up and we arrived in Cairo about 15 mins ahead of schedule. The Economy Class food was reasonable. The flight was completely full including overhead locker space I asked the flight attendant if she could hang my jacket she asked for my boarding card and when I explained its in my cabin bag at the back of the overhead locker she rather abruptly replied without a boarding card cannot hang your jacket. In other airlines they just write the seat number down on a piece of paper and attach to the hanger. I'm not sure how old the A321 was as the interior looked very dated brown seats and brown curtains surprising given the exterior of the aircraft looks quite modern in light blue with red flashes.,1
AUH to GRU: Cabin was hot and meal wasn't very good. I'm not demanding in terms of food but was not happy to see my wife and children barely eating. I thought the a/c had a problem I just had a t-shirt on and I was sweating. Second leg back to AUH: Again the cabin was too hot - very uncomfortable. It seems nonsense to keep temperatures high inside the airplane until someone complains. The flight attendants were very nice. Food again was a problem: we barely touched our first meal the last meal at the end of our flight my wife and children didn't even accept. Seat comfort entertainment are the usual similar to Emirates. Unfortunately I will not give Etihad another chance.,0
"FRA-SIN in P/E. We had booked economy but gate staff announced a ""special"" price for surplus seats in premium economy. Well it wasn't bargain basement but a reasonable price. We had already enjoyed P/E on the way over to Europe so thought why not? P/E is well worthwhile and as mentioned for previous flights should be standard. It is just so more comfortable compared with economy but much more affordable than business. Food service all extremely good and IFE is now one of the best on any airline we have traveled with - fast and responsive with a good choice of channels. Lufthansa has had some mixed reviews but I feel it has lifted its game. A380 is a superb aircraft: super smooth and quiet. We arrived feeling surpassingly refreshed and I actually got some sleep on the overnight flight for once.",1
JED-RYD and RYD-KUW economy. The downside is the ground service. Long lines for check in even to just leave your bags if you checked in online. Boarding chaos no priority. Once on board all good nice and new comfortable planes nice FA. Always a full meal even on a 1 hour flight. Bags on belt fast all flights on time.,1
RUH-MNL-RUH on 2-Oct and return on 24-Oct. Both flights were on time. Food was ok especially on the return which served 3x on a 9.5 hrs flight 1 hot meal and 2 snacks. Seats were narrow and is not suitable for taller plus size people.,1
Flight from Melbourne to Brisbane on old 737. Started in Qantas Club whereby food was good but kids section is in need of a very urgent refurbishment. Flight departed on time staff were all friendly and professional food was a hot meal and was an improved offering compared to recent pas. More taste and more of it. Arrived slightly early and bags were ready by the time we got to there. The down side to Qantas is the variation in the 737 fleet and we coped an old one with no personal TV which in 2014 is just not good enough.,1
NCE-BRU-NCE. Check-in efficient. A little delay due to a technical problem and a lost passenger inside the Nice Terminal. Economy seating quite spacious in an A319 and surprising amount of legroom. Food and drinks are for purchase however the choice offered and the quality proposed is largely worth the expense. Flight arrived with a 20 minute delay however the disembarking process went on quickly. As always at BRU bags tend to take some time to arrive but the labyrinth that gets you there does somehow reduce the sense of wait. Return flight even better. Same quality service as outbound without the delay in an A320. Worth both your money and your time. Even with buy-on- board food.,1
EDW ZRH-CLB-MLE on the 6th feb. and MLE-ZRH on the 14th feb both in Y class. Outbound night flight with hot diner and breakfast. Perfect service friendly staff clean and confortable A330. One negative point on the night flight is that they wake up passengers 2h30 before landing in CLB very annoying. Then one hour stopover in CLB remaining on board. And 1h15 flight to MLE serving sandwiches. Return flight hot lunch MÃ¶venpick ice cream during movie sandwiches before landing and countless passes with the drink trolley. All in all perfect airline with a great level of service and food quality. This charter airline is way better than many legacy carriers around Europe.,0
Schiphol to Orlando in economy. Flight on time service was excellent. The seats are no worse than BA and the food quality is very good. Return flight we upgraded to Star Class for $218 again could not fault it. The seats were large and comfortable service was 1st class and flight was pleasant. The only problem we encountered was a short delay which meant missing our connecting flight from Schiphol to Aberdeen. However staff were helpful and got us a later flight with no problems.,0
Flight from Amman to New Delhi on 29th Aug. Flight was delayed 30 minutes but what was really disappointing was the in-flight services and attitude of cabin crew. Staff were not well versed in English making it difficult to communicate. When I asked for a drink air-hostess said yes but it never came. When I requested for a feedback form I was told they never carry them. However meal quality on-board was good.,0
"My son and I took a trip to New York leaving out of Shreveport and connecting in Houston. Not one time did the flights leave on time. Then on the return trip home, the flight attendant at the entrance of the plane was letting people on in groups. She sent my 9 year old son with a group in front of me. When I tried to tell her he was my son and didn't know where to go, she begrudgingly told me to ""go on then"", then went on to say ""it isn't like he's going anywhere anyway"". I told her I didn't like her attitude at all, and instead of being a professional, she continued to try to start an argument with me. Talk about lousy customer service. Will never fly United Airlines again. ",0
"AVV-SYD. Flight arrived ex OOL but incomprehensibly inefficient boarding where an inexperienced and very slow male staff member saw us depart 20 mins late. Flight only had 70 or so passengers on the 180 seat A320. Staff went through the motions of selling the usual snacks but few passengers purchased anything. 1 female flight attendant lacked any manners and was noticeably curt to female passengers although more civil to males. The other flight attendants looked bored. The flight failed to pick up any time with arrival at the SYD airport gate some 25"" down. This flight alone would have lost a few thousand dollars. While not at a peak time one wonders how much longer before part owners such as Singapore Airlines pull the pin on the Australian operation where clearly (when not affected by natural events such as volcanic ash) flights are cancelled daily due to either an aircraft failure or low passenger numbers. Of course Tiger is not the only airline to do this: all the domestic airlines in Australia engage in such practices but Tiger is the worst based on objective BITRE figures.",0
BKK-SIN on a full A320. Check-in about 20 minutes not bad for Jetstar most importantly on time despite a full plane. All this for much less than the full service carriers. No frills but you get where you are going efficiently and this is all I want.,1

Seattle to Phoenix round trip. I was nervous about flying with US/American Airways after checking on this site there were so many poor reviews. When I got on the flights which weren't late or delayed by mechanical problems it was just like most other US domestic airlines I've flown on. The planes might have been a little old but they looked to be in about the same condition as a lot of other commercial carriers. Seats didn't seem to be any less comfortable leg room was average. Probably the biggest downside was that there was no inflight entertainment but they were only 2.5 hour flights so reading a book or playing a game was fine. The crews were nice not overly friendly and the pilots gave a few updates during the flight (both ways) which I always appreciate. I did notice that they didn't mention which baggage claim to go to at the end of either flight which would not be convenient for people that don't just do carry-ons. I'd say overall it's pretty comparable to most other airlines.,1
London City-New York JFK via Shannon on A318 but had really nice seats and professional crew. Meal served was very tasty and fresh. Overall a very good flight would use this airline again.,1
Cebu to Boracay RT. Used PAL Express/Airphils. Both flights on a Q300. Very comfortable seats. Flights all left on-time. FAs were very friendly. No food or drinks which was a negative. Not even BOB! Cabin was super warm A/C broke. Overall not bad for a short flight.,1
Flight LH419 Dulles Intl - Frankfurt Intl 25/3/2014. As I am part of the Miles & More programme I prefer to fly Lufthansa. On my last flight I was looked after well the flight left on time and landed early and I was able to choose a seat with extra leg room which is important for me.,1
As a family we have flown with Air Astana numerous times (both in economy and business class) since moving to Kazakhstan and have always been happy with the level of service. We travel with a young child and the staff have always been very friendly and helpful.,1
MAN-CFU-MAN. By booking early we got a very good deal for return flights to Corfu: in fact we would not have chosen Corfu but for the good flight prices. The journeys each way were well up to the standards we have always encountered when flying with easyJet: friendly and helpful cabin crews informative flight deck and no hassle at the departure gates. We were held for a time between the gate and the plane in each direction but still managed to depart marginally ahead of schedule and arrive a few minutes early in both cases. The only aspect that detracted from the overall experience was the seating on the A320 for our return flight: instead of the familiar easyJet seats we were faced with what looked like slimline (even economy!) seats. They seemed to offer a little more leg room and possibly better cabin visibility but the three of us all independently commented on the lack of comfort after less than an hour of a three hours' flight. The seats lacked padding and seemed foreshortened as did the armrests My rating for seat comfort is therefore based half on the outward leg and half on the return leg. I hope these uncomfortable seats do not become standard in the future.,1
"I travelled from Toronto to Colombo and back. My requested meal was low sodium. Sodium level was OK, however what was offered was completely inadequate (I am not a voracious feeder) and I was starving. I had several meals on both forward and return journey. They were almost the same kind of meals on all flights. On most occassions it was one standard dish with some potatoes or rice with chicken and green peas and a small fruit container. The tray had only these two containers and nothing else. There was absolutely nothing of salad, bun, biscuit or cheese etc.",0
JQ58 DPS-BNE. Red-eye flight which was delayed by an hour departing 0035. This was our first flight with Jetstar in business class but paid for with QFF points (classic award). This apparently meant no entitlement to lounge access at Denpasar as ticket class was insufficient +/- we hadn't requested lounge access? (Had no idea we were meant to). This was an unhappy start to the flight as we'd been hanging out for a shower after a long day in Bali. Initial impression favourable staff friendly. Drinks offered and delivered promptly food order taken. Downhill from there. Partner's meal failed to materialise - seemed like everyone was getting meals in dribs and drabs (low staffing numbers?) so we kept waiting. Gave up when we realised staff had disappeared and cabin was asleep for the night. (Yes could have followed up but we were dead on our feet and preferred to sleep). The food I received was tasteless - carrot soup with a really rubbish bread roll. Cheesecake ok. No offers of drinks when meal delivered - we'd been asked pre takeoff if we'd want drinks after takeoff and we'd declined - no opportunity to change our mind. Seats were horrible (Dreamliner 787). Hard pitiful foot rests (worse than no foot rest frankly) limited recline and difficult to achieve. Sleep was fitful and uncomfortable. Black blankets left black fluff over our clothes. No pillow only blow up neck rest in comfort packs. Entertainment system (screen in armrest) and headphones ok but choices limited compared to other airlines. Wouldn't use them again but options limited from DPS to Australia. Compared to Qantas very poor indeed.,0
BFS-LHR-BFS A320. Fully boarded 20 mins before departure on return leg so efficient turn around. Crew friendly and pretty decent service on both legs. Both legs busy - 19.20 from LHR full on return leg. Looks like EI are doing well on this route but have still reduced to 3 flights a day for winter.,1
Flew in late Dec 2013 and early Jan 2014 in Business Class from Chicago to Beijing to Bangkok and then back. The new Dreamliner was a nice comfortable flight. Some of the flight attendants don't speak English well and one of the flight attendants on the flight from Chicago to Beijing was obviously very new and was struggling - but tried none-the-less. At check-in there always seems to be confusion about what the transfer process is in Beijing. One of the real pains is that they will not issue you both tickets when you check in. If your transfer time is more than 4 hours be prepared to sit in the airport until they open the check-in counter. Note the airport in Beijing (Terminal 2 in this case) is not set up for international transfers. You will have to go through immigration and customs so do fill out both the arrival and departure forms (despite any advice to the contrary which we received from flight attendants). The immigration process is not straightforward and we were shuffled from line to line despite being in the correct line to begin with. After making it through Security (again confusing and not straight forward) don't get your hopes up on the lounge - it's a run down lounge with poor amenities - big disappointment after seeing the lounge in Terminal 1 advertised for domestic flights. In all flying internationally with Hainan is not an all positive experience but of the airline listens to its Customers and resolve these issues to bring it up to he standards and ease of flying as with most world airlines there is potential here.,0
BNE-TSV in A320 September 2013. Flight up on JQ906 was good - delay caused by passengers made up in air service efficient seat pitch and width adequate for a quick flight. 5 hours before departure we received a text message and email informing that the return flight had been cancelled - called Jetstar customer service and were put on to a slightly later QF and were given a $200 voucher for future Jetstar travel. Very happy with Jetstar customer service - particularly as the tickets were super cheap sale fares on a low cost carrier.,1
In Feb 2013 we took four flights with VN and two with their codeshare partner Cambodia Angkor Air (49% owned by VN). These flights were SIN-HAN HAN-HUI HUI-SGN SGN - REP and return (K6 flights) and SGN- SIN. We were travelling in Business Class but we were very impressed with VN's (and K6's) overall performance. AF and KLM could learn from the way in which VN handle priority boarding and (except on one flight) baggage handling. A couple of the A321s were brand new the others in good condition. The food was well judged for the length of flight and time of day. We had supper in Hanoi with friends who had travelled LGW-HAN the previous night one couple in Business Clas one in Premium Economy (called De Luxe by VN). Their comments backed up those who refer to IFE systems not working on VN's long-haul flights.,1
Took 6 BA flights as part of a OneWorld RTW trip. JFK to Berlin via LHR then 4 days later Berlin to MAN via LHR and 6 weeks later Nice to DXB again via LHR. All flights on time all cabin crew polite attentive and thoroughly professional. Refreshments meals and drinks all appropriate for the flights and times of day. It was a pleasure to fly BA after 5 flights with AA. Just one small attitude problem with a ground agent at LHR while boarding for DXB. We were snapped at and told to wait while other passengers (presumably business class) boarded. We were not in the business class 'line' but just happened to be standing near one of the two gates where boarding passes were checked. The ground agent obviously thought that we were economy class passengers trying to board early. Overall a 99% satisfactory rating for these flights. Did not use IFE so unable to give a rating.,1
KUL-KCH MH2520 19 August 2014. KCH-KUL MH2521 22 August 2014. Outbound flight almost half empty seats. Overall experience from the food IFE and crew services in term of friendliness is excellent. Inbound flight with less empty seats is similar to the outbound flight with the exception of cold sandwiches that were served to the passengers the overall experience is truly 5 star for 1.5 hour domestic flight.,1
"My daughter had travelled from UK to Thailand to visit her family. Arriving from Dubai into Bangkok, she was told that the connecting flight to Chiang Mai was delayed by one-hour, this then turned to 2-hours and eventually the flight took off almost five hours later than scheduled arriving in Chiang Mai at 3.00. By the time the passengers disembarked it was 3.35. Very little information was given, very little help was offered by the ground crew in Bangkok. The service was atrocious. I had planned the flights to coincide with a late family supper at home, this turned into a farce. Last week myself and my younger daughter travelled from India to BKK to receive the information that our connecting flight to Chiang Mai was delayed for one-hour. This is not good enough. I will not be using Bangkok Airlines again. 2 strikes and they are out!",0
Myself and my partner flew Phuket Air to BKK in Oct 04. The flight over was ok the plane was an old KLM jumbo which was tatty but comfortable. I agree with the comments about the cabin crew not being able to handle drunken louts. On the flight out there were a group of middle age men who were served alcoholic drinks from the time of serving to just prior to landing. Although they didn't cause any trouble I was very surprised that the cabin crew continued to serve them over a period of 11 hours. Our return flight was a bit of a nightmare. Having spent 6 hours waiting in Bangkok airport we boarded the plane at midnight. Our take off time came and went 40 minutes passed and we were told nothing. Then the captain said we would be taking off in 10 minutes (no apology). This came and went then another announcement there was a problem loading the luggage and we would be taking off in 10 minutes. Again this came and went. One and a half hours passed before we finally started to move. This KLM jumbo was really in bad shape and was much worse than the plane on the flight over it was dirty my table was broken and we generally didn?t feel that happy flying in it. As the plane turned the corner and revved the engine to join the runway there was the most horrendous smell of burning. We were sitting at the front end of the plane near to the kitchen in the nose cone. As the plane started to go down the runway the smell got much worse. All the cabin crew were up running about looking in all of the ovens trying to find the source of this smell. They all looked terrified which is pretty off putting to the passengers in the first place! The plane continued down the runway with the smell getting worse all the time. Even as the plane was taking off the crew continued to look for the problem. My partner and I were terrified as too seemed those people sitting around us. One lady even got us and asked the crew what was going on. They didn?t really tell her. The plane climbed very slowly with this smell still present. Whilst we were still climbing the captain came out and sniffed about with all the cabin crew flapping around him then the co-pilot came out and done the same. I think everyone on the flight feared the worst. We honestly thought we were going to be blown out of the sky. About an hour later the smell went away but we couldn?t settle after the adrenaline rush of panic. We also stopped in Sharjah which was awful as the air conditioning was switched off and we were delayed here too. We weren?t given any drinks were told not to use the toilet and weren?t allowed off the plane. Our journey home took us over 36 hours which marred the end of our holiday. I was most upset by the lack of information provided by the crew. We were not told about the burning problem or the cause of it or reassured about it there were no apologies at all. I would never fly Phuket air again nor recommend it. I am surprised that the BAA allows them to provide a long haul service from the UK.,0
NBO-EDL-NBO. Domestic flights all on time. Due to the newly burnt NBO airport boarding was primitive and lengthy and we were 5-10 passengers who lost our flight due to lack of calls for boarding other routes were announced clearly. As there was a mess in the temporarily domestic airport there were no facilities no signboard nor search for passengers. Strangely enough my luggage was unloaded (correctly) but I was furious as I was accused for No Show despite sitting straight in front of the only exit way in the tent where all domestic passengers had to walk through to their flights. However some apology was received and they rebooked me instantly for the following morning but only as a ?prioritized waitlist passenger. However I got the last seat and was pleased to eventually get it. Otherwise all flights on time pleasant FA-service and good announcements on board. Almost new aircraft's Embraer 175 and 170 respectively. No lounges available despite holding SkyTeam Gold. After request they offered me 1 snack and 1 soft drink in Nairobi. The lounge in EDL not available for non-VIPs.,1
"DXB-KBP-LGW. Both planes were 737-800s but the seating was not identical. On the Dubai-Kiev leg the seating was cramped my knees were knocking the seatback pocket and anyone much taller than me (178 cm / 5'10"") would likely have found it very uncomfortable. The Kiev-Gatwick leg however offered what was clearly roomier seating with minimal knee-seat contact. The latter seating also seemed slightly more frayed; I gained the impression that slightly better legroom was in the older plane. Otherwise there's no getting around the fact that despite being Ukraine's national airline UIA are also a budget airline with no in-flight entertainment and no free food (only limited food options for a cost) on short or medium-haul flights - which includes Dubai-Kiev. If you go into the flight knowing this then the really competitive cost makes UIA worth considering as the flights seem to be punctual staff are professional and transiting at the UIA-dedicated Terminal D at Boryspil is easy fast and painless. If you go into a short- or medium-haul route with UIA expecting full service from a national airline then you'll likely be disappointed. I imagine that the Skytrax 2-star rating reflects the lack of entertainment and limited food options - but judge UIA as a budget airline and they're better than many of their European competitors in the similar price bracket and I've had much worse experiences with full-service North American airlines on (internal) flights of similar length to my individual legs here. If I had to keep costs down on a route covered by UIA's network I'd certainly consider them again.",1
"Chicago O'Hare to Seoul return two weeks later. The seats were more comfortable with more leg room than expected so I was able to sleep in Economy Class. Flight attendants were professional and helpful. While the meals weren't always to my taste they were served and cleaned up efficiently. An unexpected perk was the layover in Seoul where I was able to enjoy the 4th floor ""Rest and Relax"" area.",1
Usually I fly Elite (Economy plus) but I received an upgrade to Business Class at LAX probably due to Diamond status. Great experience: lay-flat seats with lots of space very functional mini cabin with privacy the multi- course meal was accompanied by excellent wines. No complaints. The IFE could have a bit better selection but given that one can really sleep in those seats it is not possible to watch more than two or three movies. Restrooms were kept very clean and cabin service was First Class! Much better than on any US or European airline. Baggage came within a few minutes after reaching the belt. Overall a memorable experience.,1
AMM-BEY on an nice clean embraer. Leg room is average cup cake was served. The trip was only 45-60 minutes. But what I really liked is RJ has a security check on board their aircraft's. FAs were okay all in all average flight.,1
We were supposed to fly out of Ottawa to Orlando last Saturday the 15th Feb at 6am. We got to the AP at 3am boarded the plane around 5.30am and then were told to exit the plane because there was a delay. Needless to say we spent the entire day sitting in the airport and didn't board until 7pm that night. We missed an entire day of our vacation because of this. Will never fly SW again.,0
"British Airways Business Class product has not really changed over the last 15 years, and they are now far behind competition in seat comfort (half of the passengers must still fly facing backwards) and entertainment. What once made BA a great airline was the cabin crew who treated their passengers like guests. Unfortunately, they are slowly retiring and replaced by younger employees who could care or less about high revenue passengers. On this particular flight, the cabin was half full, but the crew rushed the service to an extent I have never seen before: the pre-dinner drinks were served, and less than 5 minutes later, I was served the first course. I did not even start the salad when the plate was taken away and I was presented with a beef fillet that was totally overcooked. Ten minutes later, the trays were taken away, and the lights dimmed. We did not see the crew again for the next 9 hours, and no water or juice were ever served. Unfortunately BA has the only non-stop flight between Cape Town and London, but next time I will fly Emirates via Dubai even if that means adding 4 hours to the trip.",0
Narrow seats with very little legroom. The staff were rude and with an awful attitude. Free food obviously. ICE was not what I expected. My fingers were almost broken trying to click on screen. The Boeing 777-300ers some brand new still seemed jaded. As for DXB I will return to European hubs. Disappointed my first time. Expected so much more. The staff badly need to change their attitude.,0
"Flew Business Class DOH-BOM-DOH. Outbound: Used the Oryx lounge at Doha airport which was nice. Cabin was nearly empty. Seats are similar to those on Jet's domestic business class. Found it difficult to sleep with the recline provided. At 6'3"" legrests did not help as my legs overshot it. The light sandwich was passable. Service was attentive and cheerful. Inbound: Evening flight so looked forward to meal and wine. Same cheap French table wine. Indian non-veg meal was not great. Cabin crew were attentive and friendly. IFE was limited. One negative was that my bag was one of the last off both flights with a priority tag.",0
Worst flight ever! Flew with 3 small children (2 6 & 8). Horrible service. Non-existant entertainment (most of the movies were circa 1993 or older). Air Canada saw fit to rearrange our pre-paid assigned seats. None of us were sitting together. My 2 year old was supposed to sit alone 2 rows behind me. And our girls were also alone. Asked for help at 1800 # and checkin desk and was told there was nothing they could do. Same story at the gate and was told I would have to ask passengers for help. Added in a random stopover that wasn't on the original booking. Made us get off the plane on that stopover and get back on the same plane (& same crew) 20 min later in new seats that we once again had to rearrange! Seats are horrendously uncomfortable. What a total disaster. I have flown many times with my kids - never had a problem before. We only flew AC this time as we were able to book our tickets on points.,0
"This is not the first time I have flown on Spirit. We feel that their on going value pricing is deceitful unreasonable and unfair. Bags should not cost $100 to check if you have to check them at the last minute. Situations come up during travels not everything can be planned so nicely. Your seats both regular and ""big"" are very uncomfortable. I have ridden in both. No seats on the plane recline and are thinly cushioned. The check-in procedures and policy to charge at the counter is unreasonable. Issues and/or availability to a computer or smart phone can often change the passenger should not be expected to incur expenses because of it. I was unable to confirm the purchase of seats for the person I made a reservation with because they did not have an email account. I feel like they intentionally avoid giving important specific information.",0
I have travelled several times to Dublin Edinburgh Spain and Manchester. Each time the plane was on time and the staff very helpful. Exeter airport I give the highest rating for their efficiency and friendly approach to each customer.,1
Terrible airline experience. I bought a ticket for my girlfriend the flight was from Minneapolis to Portland with a stop in Chicago. 4 hour delay in Minneapolis because of weather. But then they flew to Chicago and then canceled the flight to Portland. Next available flight was 3 days later. Ended up buying a last minute ticket on another airline just to avoid her being stranded for 3 days. Terrible and very costly experience.,0
2 weeks ago my husband and I went to New Zealand. For years we travelled with Air Canada or Air New Zealand and this last time we made a big mistake and decided to fly with United. We prolonged our arrival to Auckland by a few good hours but we would have co-oped with these extra hours had it not been for the awful time on the flight to and from Auckland. There is no room for peoples legs. This is a very long flight and airlines need to consider peoples health. The food was awful. Cold and not edible. The flight attendants beyond rude. I was shocked when 2 of them who could not decide if the liquid in the pots was tea or coffee simply removed the lids and put their noses in. When we got to Sydney Australia we embarked on an Air New Zealand flight to Auckland. What a huge difference. All of the sudden we could stretch our legs. The food was edible and the flight attendants were courteous. Going back home to Canada the experience repeated itself. We flew Air New Zealand to Sydney and everything was good and then hell repeated itself when we had to embark Untied from Sydney to Canada. My husband and I decided that never again will we fly United.,0
"SQ978 from Singapore to Bangkok. Flight arrived 10 minutes ahead of schedule on 13 June 2015, flight attendant was polite and friendly. I ordered the seafood meal and it was delicious. On 19 June 2015 on the way back from Bangkok seafood meal was good and very tasty. It was my fathers birthday and the cabin crew helped to it a special flight and to surprise my dad. In-flight entertainment offered lots of movies. The cabin crew on SQ978 offered top ups of my tomato juice without me having to ask. Economy seat is clean and new.",1
Terrible customer service! We were delayed coming back from Punta Cana. Not a Sunwing rep in sight at the airport. All signs showed on time even after we had been delayed a couple of hours with no explanation. Had to walk out to the tarmac not so bad to do in Punta Cana but not so nice when arriving back in Moncton in a snow storm. Make sure you're wearing proper shoes and bring a coat back with you. Luggage was damaged during the non-stop flight from Punta Cana to Moncton. The Sunwing reps are not being helpful in expediting compensation for that. Once they have your money you're on your own. Don't expect any help!,0
SQ947 and SQ378 Aug 19 2014. DPS-SIN and SIN-MXP. Nice flights attendants were perfect meal ok too many uninteresting movies.,1
Flew 'main cabin select' from LAX to SFO. Flight was delayed. Seats were reassigned due to equipment change even though it was the exact same configuration. Main Cabin Select includes dedicated overhead compartment. We boarded ahead of the rest of the main cabin and put our blazers in the overhead compartment. Flight attendant told us it was a full flight and our coats had to go on the floor in front of us. (What happened to ?dedicated overhead compartment??? Flight attendants were aloof and came across as uncaring even on a 55-minute flight (that was delayed over 3 hours).,0
Flew Air Macau from Tapei to Macau and back during the Chinese New Year. A321 were deployed at the TPE-MFM sector. Economy class was full seats were cramped but bearable for the 1.5 hr flight. Food was poor. MFM-TPE sector had no boarding bridge so has to take the bus to the aircraft. Which I find it quite annoying given how small the Macau International Airport was and not much traffic go through Air Macau still can't find a boarding bridge. Again food was poor on the way back. Crew on both flight were efficient though but lack of smile and can clearly felt that they were treating Business Class passengers better when the curtain between the two classes is still open.,0
Excellent value for money airline with great staff and always on time. I have flown with the airline several times this year and they have a knack of getting you to your destination early.,1
Business class from London to New York I cannot believe how bad it was and can understand why there were only 5 passengers in Business and 1st. The flight was delayed by one hour with no apology and Gulf Air Lounge staff said this was common occurrence. The plane was so old and smelled of smoke that I was shocked. The entertainment system did not work and the in-flight crew said this was pretty normal. They could not find me an alternative seat on an empty plane where something worked. It was almost impossible to get the control unit out of the seat and there would have been no point anyway as systems were not working. I could not even get the light to work and if the TV did work the screen is no larger than my phone. For a Business Class seat I was staggered that even the leg rest was more of a foot rest as it did not straighten out or extend. The food was abysmal. Unfortunately I have to fly back to London on Sat 20th Sept and I am dreading the flight.,0
"Some staff professional but others quite rude. Do not pay for the so-called priority boarding we were made to wait on the long check in line as the ""security"" man did not appear to understand that we should have access to the priority line. Seats uncomfortable some food selections unavailable flights both ways delayed and so on. Having said that they are cheap and fly a route we travel. Like the small airports. But if there was any other option for this same route non-stop I'd gladly pay more to avoid Allegiant.",0
TFN-GMZ return on ATR72. Very good 25 minute flights. Served cup of water and chocolate bar. Great views of a snow capped Mt Teide on left going and right returning.,1
"We were booked on flight from NYC/JFK to Madrid. We were arriving by connection from San Francisco and were checked through from San Francisco to Madrid by the Air France ticketing agent at SFO. On arriving at JFK we went to the Air Europa gate. There were many other passengers in the same situation as us i.e. arriving from other destinations and taking the JFK to Madrid connection with Air Europa. As boarding commenced many of us were told that Air Europa would no longer accept the boarding pass printed at our point of embarkation and that we would have to get boarding passes reprinted. There were 4 agents at the gate doing nothing. They told us to go outside security to get our boarding passes reprinted and then re-enter. We dozen or so passengers started running for the ticketing counters. When we got there there was a huge line. Only one agent was doing ticketing. Our flight was leaving in 10 minutes so I requested that the agent deal with us dozen passengers. It was clear that since we were all unrelated passengers connecting through JFK from different points of origin that the problem was on Air Europa's side. It is not possible that so many agents in so many different airports for so many different passengers screwed up at the same time. We were all in danger of missing our flight but none of the Air Europa agents could be bothered. They said ""Next time you should be more careful to make sure your tickets are correct!"" Admonishing us as if we were at fault. I looked at the boarding passes we had been given by the ticketing agent in SFO and they looked completely correct. How were we to check if they were ""correct""? Finally we were ticketed and we ran to get through security. We had 2 minutes to get through security but the line was 15 minutes long. I went to the line and told the TSA agents about the situation. The TSA agents took the entire group of us and allowed us to go through a fast line in the security. We made the flight but the service we received was extremely rude and unprofessional.",0
LA501 connecting to LA750 on 10 May - MIA-SCL-GRU. Both 787's (actually was the same plane for both flights) in good shape and excellent flight. Flown LAN many times and this time the crew was good but lacked the warmth I had on other flights. They did one drink run (as stated in a previous review) but if you needed anything just ring the call button. They come immediately and happy to get you what you want. Dinner was excellent - delicious soup and cheeses entree of shrimp and veggies. Slept thru breakfast so can't comment. LAN Biz seats are the best - I always can sleep 5 hours easily on them. Quick 1 hour connection in SCL - security check took a minute if not less. Almost 3 hour flight to Sao Paulo - 1/2 filled cabin. Friendly service and they left you alone to sleep if needed. Tasty breakfast and good movies to watch. Had an aborted landing so landed a bit late - bag was last off the plane (even with priority tags) but was just glad to get it. Overall a good trip - I would just say I wish their TV shows were more than 1-2 episodes; for a 8-10 hour trip you would enjoy to see 6-10 episodes available. Too bad they don't fly from ORD directly.,1
BEG-ARN-BEG. Like flying with two different companies. On the first flight to Stockholm it felt like Fawlty Towers on a plane and the purser played the fictional character Manuel. If he could get something wrong he did. The aperitif and nuts came with the main meal ?because it is more convenient?? Announcements made on board not understandable because of the poor English spoken in a very fast way. Even though the incompetence of the purser was kind of entertaining from occasionally the whole experience was a disappointment. However things could not have been better than the return flight to Belgrade. Excellent purser and staff who made everything right and could not be more accommodating. Thumbs up! Strangely enough though no champagne offered before takeoff but has to be asked for. Food tasteful but the main dishes slightly dry.,1
Flew Gatwick to Goa on Dreamliner. Lovely plane with good spacious seats. Reasonable food and good drink service. Pleasant cabin crew.No complaints. Would use them again.,1
"Here we go again. Only one whole week since my last poor review and I'm subjected to another delayed Friday evening flight: this time by 90 minutes. Honestly if Flybe can't run a more reliable service for the prices charged then maybe this is the wrong business to be in. Evening delays on this 'service' are regularly delayed and make a long day even longer. It does nothing for the stress levels. I am not sure who thinks up the message ""sit back and relax"" that's difficult when the delay means letting others down again. Why doesn't a Flybe rep (a real face and not an announcer) step into the departures area and speak to passengers personally. I will switch back to using Eastjet out of Gatwick. In 7 years of using Easyjet I was subject to a lengthy delay only twice (due to bad weather). This repeated poor service by Flybe is infuriating. Smarten up Flybe.",0
I took my friend to London-Gatwick on 24-12-06. He was expecting to fly with Air Zimbabw eat 1900 hrs that evening & arrive in Harare at 7am on Christmas day. On trying to check in we realised there were 2 separate queues one for those with tickets for 23 Dec and one for those with tickets for 24 Dec. That is all the information that was given and no explanation - even though there was only one flight scheduled for Harare that evening. We waited for 4 hrs only to be told that those with tickets for 24 Dec were not flying because their plane had been given to those whose flight had been cancelled the previous day!?,0
I was rescheduled to an earlier flight which is PR880. I was surprised to experienced their new A321. Flight PR880 was on time departing 7.45pm from Cebu to Manila. The flight attendants are all up beat and friendly. The inflight snacks was a biscuit and peanuts only. The seat in economy was fine for a short trip. The seat reclines a little and the seat slides forward. What I liked is the attentiveness of the cabin crews. After 50 minutes in the air we landed smoothly and on-time.,1
"MEX-MAD 777 in Business Class! Fast and efficient check-in quick security checkpoint crossing and amazing VIP Lounge! Efficient Priority boarding and onboard nice big lie flat ""pod"" seats! Very good IFE and delicious food with nice staff. Nice quiet smooth flight with lots of entertainment.",1
"KUL-ORY with AirAsiaX A340-300. The flight was on-time and 95% full. The seat would be more comfortable if it's an inch wider no problem with the 32"" seat pitch though. For the lower fare you get what you pay for. 2 round of hot meals came with 350ml bottle water each food delicious and spicy (Asian meal) but the portion is very small. Water can be purchased onboard for a reasonable price. Cabin crew doing a good job overall.",1
Lagos to Tripoli was ok except the deplorable condition of the toilet no inflight entertainment cabin crews were boring beyond description meal was ok. Landed at Tripoli airport on time and cheerful ground crew. I have never seen a worse and appalling toilets like what I saw at the Tripoli airport. Tripoli to Gatwick flight was ok a better and newer aircraft more responsive cabin crew inflight entertainment though without headset arrived Gatwick on time. Return flight was almost a replication of the inbound flights except that there was headset for inflight entertainment. Afriqiyah should replace aircraft flying Lagos leg its below international standard and they dare not fly such aircraft to Gatwick. Will fly them if they improve on the hygiene,0
Flew from Mumbai to Hong Kong. Flight was supposed to leave ay midnight and was delayed 3 times with no notification. Finally boarded plane at 6 am. No food or compensation provided for delays. Poor service in the flight as well. Would not travel again.,0
We travelled from Luton to Targu Mures in Romania. It is a must to purchase priority check-in/seating. The queue at the regular check-in counter at Luton was unbelievable for 6am on a Sunday morning. Priority check-in allows you to go to a separate queue that is much shorter. Staff were friendly and efficient. Make sure that you only have one piece of carry on luggage. My wife and I both had a carry on bag and smaller hand bag each. We had to stuff the smaller into the larger. You must ensure that your carry on bag fits within the specified dimensions. We witnessed one poor fellow whose carry on case was within the specified dimensions except for the small wheels. He was made to pay the 50 Euro excess. Boarding was speedy - the aircraft appeared to be brand new - the inflight service ok - the flight was smooth and the exit in Romania was uneventful. Overall recommended but watch for the traps.,1
We were travelling in a group and the experience was good. The cabin crew were friendly and attentive. Flight was on time and our baggage also arrived on time at the new KLIA2. Choice of food and beverage on board were good and reasonably priced. Our only suggestion is for AirAsia X to consider free in-flight entertainment for flights more than 5hrs flying time/distance.,1
December 2012 round trip between Madison WI and Washington DC. The planes were up-to-date and the seats very comfortable. The service was superb at check-in gate and through the flight. Crew were organized and friendly. A nice touch was the raising of the cabin lights during beverage service. Many food items were available for sale. We didn't buy any but liked that there were options. Flights were comfortable and calm.,1
Bangkok to Melbourne. Attentive flight attendants with good service all the way. Food plentiful and tasty. Food was well presented and hot. Cabin attendants were cheerful and very pleasant. Seats were comfortable and enabled good rest especially between Brunei and Melbourne. Flights departed and arrived on time. Now my first choice for flights from Australia to Asia and beyond.,1
KL1263 full 737-700 very good service level and attentive staff. The nice views above the Alps makes this Saturday morning flight complete in the positive way!,1
The staff constantly see the need to come behind the curtain exposing two bright lights to passengers who pay the privilege of sitting in row 1A in executive class. These insensitive staff feel the need to conduct a loud and animated conversation within the executive cabin throughout the night. We pay for lie flat beds and are constantly subjected to being woken up at constant period throughout the night and not from fellow passengers. The food is poor and who cares for duty free so why do they need to charge down the aisle every 15 minutes. My rubbish was never collected.,0
Flight delayed 4 hours. No Vueling representative present at airport to explain why. Was also put on 'Standby' as they overbook each flight by 10% and as we were last to check in they moved us to a later flight as our original flight was full.,0
Wizz Air allocated seats. Booked a three adults and two infants flight and we're all sitting apart. Complete lack of customer care. ,0
Terrible experience with Kenya Airways. Flew from London to Nairobi in September. After losing our luggage they didn't seem very concerned or willing to help. We had to keep complaining to get them to do anything and kept getting passed from one employee to another. The next morning we had to fly from Nairobi to Kilimanjaro on Precision Air which is a subsidiary of Kenya Airways and got bumped from our flight until 12 hours later. Then they didn't take anyone's luggage on the flight! They told us that the luggage would arrive the next day but it didn't arrive until 4 days later. By that time we were on Mount Kilimanjaro using rented and purchased gear. At no time did the airline offer to reimburse us. Finally at the end of our trip we had to fly on Kenya airways from Nairobi to London. We arrived at the airport 3 hours before the flight and when we checked in the agent told us we were on standby! We created a big enough stink that they gave us our boarding passes. Then the flight was 3 hours late departing. Also on both Air Kenya flights the food wasn't very good and the inflight entertainment units didn't work well. If we ever fly back to Africa we would never fly Kenya Airways again.,0
Flew Premium from PER-KUL-HND and I have only few complaints. Crew are very friendly. Same with the pilots they give you regular updates about weather etc. The premium seat is comfortable and good for over night flights but it can get a bit uncomfortable when lying down because it angles down slightly so you tend to slip. Complimentary pillow and blanket both are a great size. Food is great! I had chicken lasagne which was very tasty and had a great range of flavours. The cabin was extremely clean. No mess whatsoever. One of my favourite carriers now. And it's a LCC!,1
DFW-BNE-SYD on 9/8-10/14 in Business Class upper deck of 747. Excellent flight in every respect: spacious seat layout very comfortable seats in all positions but particularly in sleep mode good food especially the late night supper. Flight attendants were experienced and efficient friendly and accommodating. Video selections a bit odd but interesting with plenty of choices. New crew and another breakfast from Brisbane to Sydney equally good. Qantas lounges in DFW and Brisbane were fine. Luggage on the carousel before we arrived after a fast pass through immigration.,1
LCY-AMS (as part of onward to LIN). Left on time on a windy day but were warned and soon out of the worst of it. Coffee and muffin enough for such a short flight. Bags at final destination so what more could be asked - and a reasonable price. Only very small gripe-getting very tired of these multiple flight numbers on one aircraft - there must be a better way.,1
FOR-GIG-FOR all in economy class (A320). Seating cramped but no worse than most economy class seats these days. The snack served each way on this 3.5 hour flight was perhaps the most environmentally unfriendly food service I've seen: a large plastic tray wrapped in plastic containing a very small packet of a couple of small crackers another packet (plastic wrapped) with a small cake and a small toil-wrapped cube of cheese). Much more plastic than used to be used when the airline served hot foil-wrapped ham and cheese sandwiches. A child became ill on the flight when we landed people started to disembark then were told to re-board the plane until a health official came on board. In-flight entertainment consisted of overhead monitors every few rows with volume that could be heard by almost no one. Flight back was less eventful. Just the same plastic-enclosed snack.,0
Paid for the full upgrade to Select Service - arrived at airport and no record that we paid this (luckily I had my receipt). Outbound we got what we paid for on return from the Caribbean - got the seats we booked but nothing else. We were the last people served a meal 2 meal selections and the one I chose was gone! Asked for blankets/pillows and told we should have kept the ones from the flight down. Not offered our beverage until 30 mins prior to landing! Staff seemed very disorganized Arrived late as there were multiple delays.,0
East Midlands to Malaga If you follow the rules you get a cheap flight but at what cost. The seat is poor even for budget airlines with the leg room the worst I have known in 30 years flying. Then there is the width. Yes I am a big chap but I have never had to ask for an extender belt it went no where near. Dignity lost but cheap fares and safe arrival.,1
I travelled Manchester - Sydney return on 777-300 ER. The service was mediocre on 3 of the 4 legs with a poor selection of food warm champagne and no single malts. The crew were almost robotic and did not show any real deep customer care. The service was rushed and served without any finesse unlike Singapore and Emirates. The new seat/bed was ok but felt tight and squeezed in. Obviously on this airline they have crammed in as many seats as possible with no space to move around the plane. I am 1.80 in height and slim and getting in and out of my seat 17K unless the seat was completely upright was a struggle. Boarding on all 4 legs as a BC passenger was chaotic and a stress. In Hong Kong it was unbelievable. 14 staff and not one singing off the same hymn sheet. Also in HK no one welcomed us onboard either on entry or when we were seated. The crew manager spent all her time at the front of the plane and never entered to serve or speak with the passengers in any class on the HK to Manchester leg on 18 Feb 2015. She was unapproachable and aloof. The business class lounge at Manchester was a joke and in Hong Kong was nice when inside the staff were distant and robotic. In Sydney we used the Qantas lounge winch was a delight. I would not spend Â£3700 with this airline again but will travel Singapore or Emirates BC when I travel long haul and wouldn't use Manchester again I'll travel through Heathrow.,0
My flight was cancelled to NYC where I was supposed to have a 3 hour lay-over before catching an international flight to London. 2 hours before flight time JetBlue cancelled my flight and rebooked me on a flight the next day. I spent over 1 hour on the phone with them mainly on hold while they were supposed to figure out how I could get from Rochester NY down to JFK in time for my flight. After over an hour's wait a supervisor got back to me and said - sorry nothing we can do - flight is canceled due to weather. I asked where was the weather problem. As she was saying that there is a lot of rain in NYC I was looking at the weather.com report that reported partly sunny skies at JFK. Because of the weather excuse I cannot get compensation from my travel insurance. I have lost a day of vacation will be late for a family wedding and have had to pay a hefty fee to rebook my flight overseas. Thanks a lot Jet Blue.,0
SAN-SFO. Admittedly this is an incredibly brief (under 2 hour) flight but everything about Virgin America impressed. Flight was cheap but the experience was better than first class in other airlines. Numerous entertainment options (with excellent satellite reception) comfortable seats very attentive staff and in SFO a terminal almost exclusively for the airline. The most pleasant flying experience in as long as I can recall.,1
LHR-BEY-LHR. Both flights on A330 aircraft. Smooth flights. Nice cabin and entertainment. Really friendly crew both on ground and inflight. Food was good. However seat belt checks are not done when the plane was taking off one crew member was up giving a baby a bottle of milk and went running to her seat while the plane was on the middle of the runway. Enjoyed the flights will travel again.,1
I flew Comfort Class from IST to JFK. I've always been impressed with the service on economy class Turkish Airlines so I spent the upgrade for Comfort. I'd compare the legroom and quality of service to domestic American Airlines Business Class. It's nearly business class levels of comfort for about 20% more than economy would've cost me. The food was excellent I appreciate being given choices for my meals and drinks as well as having porcelain dishware. The entertainment selection is one of the best I've had on an airline. I first flew Turkish about 2 years ago simply because it was the cheapest option. After experiencing such great service I only fly them when I'm headed to Eastern Europe/ Middle East.,1
Flew from Las Vegas to Cincinnati on May 14. Flight took off and landed on time. All employees were friendly professional and helpful. The flight was comfortable. I paid extra to choose my seat and check my bag and both were worth it. Even with the extra charges it cost more that $200 less than Delta. I will definitely fly Allegiant in the future.,1
BSB-GRU in A320. No thrills reasonable legroom good individual IFE system for a domestic route. Would be a good option if the company had a more robust network and consistent and reliable services.,1
We flew JetBlue to San Juan Puerto Rico - no problems or delay. Coming home through Philadelphia to Richmond VA 3/22/2014 was a disaster for several reasons. U.S. Airlines from San Juan was an Airbus 330 and we waited for 50 minutes on the runway while every puddle jumper took off which made us within 15 minutes to get our 7.15pm flight to Richmond VA. We landed in concourse F and had to get to concourse A and get a transfer bus. No help from the airline ground staff to expedite or help us. They seem oblivious to our situation and offered no help. They were rude and non caring.,0
AKL/HNL + Maui and back. Flight up ok apart from seating at rear of cabin (we had paid for this trip in March). Poor food and expensive inflight entertainment. Maui to HNL my wife and I were seated in separate areas of the cabin! HNL to AKL seated even further apart. Seating arrangements Maui/HNL sorted by very helpful passenger service agent. Seating arrangement HNL/AKL sorted by paying additional $US75 each. Never again. Note we had booked and paid for this trip 6 months before flying.,0
Excellent flight from London Heathrow to Abu Dhabi. Good comfortable flat beds with extremely attentive staff. Food hot and tasty well presented and an abundance of alcoholic drinks if desired. Toilets very clean and attended to extremely frequently. Entertainment was fine and just right for the length of flight 7 hours. I have travelled several times with Qatar and Emirates Etihad are just as good.,1
This review is regarding the customer service at JetBlue.com. I had a complaint about a third- party service I ordered through the jetblue web site. I made the complaint through their web submission and they followed up and resolved the issue to my satisfaction. I guess I shouldn't be surprised when an airline actually has good customer service but I am.,1
"Like many people on this site we have used Ryanair before like many we abide by their rules don't necessarily like them but we abide by them. We have a young child so we booked priority boarding - the only airline I know that doesn't allow this as standard (but fair enough that's their policy we know that in advance). So hold luggage booked priority boarding additional infant equipment all paid for. Flying from Edinburgh to Faro was okay long queues at check-in but okay. Trek at Faro up and down stairs 2 year old and 3 bags not great but can't blame Ryanair (although can't help but think they are treated as 3rd class because of the deals they make with airports). Chaos on way back one person at check-in no priority queue at boarding pass check. Advised it would be at the gate nope people were allowed to stampede if you were already at the back tough! So on return to UK I complained and requested that the priority boarding fee was refunded. Rather than customer service I received a curt ""we do not make refunds"". So despite not getting what we paid for they pocket the money anyway Will we use them again probably simply they put they get you there but I will treat them with the same respect that they show their customers.",0
Flew back from Crete and after booking and paying for emergency seats for extra leg room - on boarding aircraft found we didn't get them. Crew were useless told us to take seats and speak to customer relations when we got back. Jet2 do not want to speak to you when you get back. Have tried email and letter and not had a reply. Worst customer service ever.,0
Taipei to Bangkok. They mentioned on their website that one has to show the credit card with which their ticket was bought and was worried about that as I had used a friends credit card and didn't carry it with me. But at Taipei check in none of those happened. The check in staff was friendly and he had even waived off my excess weight beyond the 20kg limit. Also they could through check in my entire luggages till Calcutta which was my final destionation. The flight took about 4hours wasn't eventful. Food was alright. IFE a good collection of movies/tv shows. Flight attendants looked great in their green uniforms they were attentive and helfpul.,1
I have taken 3 flights from Des Moines IA to Las Vegas the last 3 years. Overall the price was good flights on time and staff friendly. Even with the added costs of luggage seat purchase etc the airline is still cheaper than others. The older MD 83 aircraft are a cause for concern and I am aware from friends that they have higher than average delay rate. I will still fly them because of price and non-stop service. All airlines have problems.,1
JFK to Fort Myers. Staff were helpful and friendly. Stewardesses were courteous. Inflight TVs are great. Also the first bag free check in makes sense. A great experience especially when traveling with two young children.,1
We flew on Cubana to Hrvana via Holguin check in was chaotic. The plane was very old no inflight entertainment and food was not that great either. You have pay for any extra hard or soft drinks. The staff were very old compared to other airlines. The return on was worse. The plane had a fault and we had to wait for another plane. We were kept at the airport for over 8 hours with one sandwich and 1 drink. No toilet paper in the toilets and no inflight entertainment. Please do not book unless you have no choice.,0
TCX172 26th December and TCX173 16th January. I must admit that I was dreading flying with Thomas Cook and became obsessed with reading the reviews trying to find a good one but I was very surprised and happy. we flew from Gatwick to Punta Cana on December 26th. Check in was a breeze and the flight was on time. The seats are fine we booked exit seats row 9 H and K so about 6 foot of room in front of us. The food was not bad the crew were lovely and didn't stop for the whole of the flight they were very chatty. The return flight was just as great I have no problem with flying with them again in fact after this flight I must admit that the service was far better than Virgin Premium Economy.,1
"Flights on China Airlines are fine. My complaint is about their frequent flyer program. Don't bother. They give you an award ticket for 30000 miles but it is only good for Hawaii which has no Availability through the year end (a full 12 months at the time of our attempt) at which point the ticket is no longer valid. So we had to make a special request to ""downgrade"" our award to 25000 miles so we could chose any flight in the continental US. Still pretty much impossible to get a ticket. The stupid thing is the staff will sit with you on the phone for hours trying. First they have to plug in a specific flight both outbound and return and then wait for their partner airline to get back to them. It is always unavailable even though the super saver discounted tickets are still not sold out on the web site. So they not only waste my time but they pay their staff to sit on the phone and go through this useless exercise. Eventually the staff will tell you that they can't stay on the phone all day!",0
Madrid to Cali seats were comfortable staff pleasant and nice. A330 airbus is welcoming and the service onboard was good. I flew from UK with a connecting flight in Madrid then on to Cali. Aircraft was on time. Menu was nice especially on flights going to Colombia.,1
Travelled to Entebbe via Cairo return. 3 of my 4 trips delayed by at least 90 mins to 2 hrs. The excuse on the first occasion was that we were waiting for a First Class passenger. One of my bags delayed for 2 days when I arrived in Entebbe. I also booked a vegetarian meal no problem here but all 4 hot meals were the same rice and grilled vegetables. The service on the flights staff and transfer through Cairo were fine. But generally the planes particularly on the Entebbe legs were cramped and poor quality compared to others on that route.,0
SSH-LXR-SSH Dash 8 Q-300. A bit dubious as I had never heard of this Egyptian carrier and the name doesn't inspire a great deal of confidence but I was pleasantly surprised. A new aircraft on this short 50 minute flight comprehensive safety demo in English that was understandable. Complimentary juice and a small snack provided I would not hesitate to use this airline again.,1
Emirates have very clean and modern aircraft excellent entertainment and easy transfers to and from flights within Dubai. Unfortunately the cabin crew are not upholding the Emirates values which crew displayed 10 yrs ago. I was shocked at the decline of customer care once showed by crew in economy. I flew from MEL-DXB to Italy return crew were rude never smiled avoided pax told pax to wait for the next service upon drink requests and did everything to make for an unpleasant flight. Next time I will fly another carrier. Crew should treat every pax as they would want their family members treated and remember they have chosen to be there!,0
Flew with Thomson to Mombasa for the first time on Dreamliner. The aisles are too narrow so constant buffeting by stewards had to pay for coffee and when queried the steward was rude and suggested we fly with another airline next time the stewards were chatting all night in the galley so no sleep our cases together with those of 50 other passengers left on plane which had parked elsewhere at Gatwick. No one from Thomson available for comment at the time so had to hang around for an hour and a half awaiting outcome. Stressful experience all round and no help from customer services so we will not use this company again.,0
LHR to BKK return 8 December return 20 January. Check-in all smooth and hassle free departures and arrivals on time economy seats little hard but get what you pay for. Cabin staff polite and professional food good and entertainment ok for long haul flight. I have flown EVA on this route 4 or 5 times now and have to say very happy with them and will look to book again if price is right later this year.,1
Flew out to Sanford Orlando from BHX on 27/3/15 on a six week old Dreamliner 787. Fantastic plane really impressed with the spaciousness larger windows and lighting and a very pleasant and attentive cabin crew. I am a nervous flyer and due to very strong head wind our flight took longer than usual and was quite turbulent. The crew were very kind to me and helped me to relax into the flight. The food was good and an excellent drinks service. The entertainment selection was also very good. Leg room great (we were in a middle row seats 18 DE and F) and no problems if the person in front reclined their seat. However the return flight on 10.04.15 was less pleasant. Again quite a bumpy ride - the seatbelt signs were on and off for the first four hours which was unfortunate but can't be helped. The Cabin Crew businesslike but totally disinterested no eye contact or engagement whatsoever Food and drink thrust at you and I had no blanket! The area around our seats (19 DE and F) had a very strong smell of vomit the whole journey and the plane looked a bit grubby. The toilet by row 30 ran out of toilet paper and paper towels half way through too! Obviously with an overnight flight the crew leave you to rest and darken the cabin but I don't think many people actually did sleep as we were all still on Florida time - it was very hot on the plane and people all around me were complaining of being thirsty - there was quite a large time gap between drinks service. A lady across from our party was feeling unwell and had no assistance from the cabin crew at all! Her family were left to attend to her and left with a pile of dirty tissues and sick bags around them. Not good enough Thomson! Customer service should be of equal quality with all of your Cabin crews whatever time of flight. 10/10 for staff outbound but only 2/10 inbound.,1
LHR-BKK return. Plane was brand new 777-300ER on-time both ways. Cabin crew great  tasty food. Good value for money considering the service we received.,1
TLV-FRA Boeing 737-800. King David Lounge at TLV a pleasure quiet and with good food and wine. Onboard greeted by a charming purser and his colleague. Always addressed by name. While the seat is not a lie-flat seat like LX or BA use to TLV it is more comfortable than the so-called business seat that LH and OS use. There could be more recline and more space between the rows but overall fine. Food and wines fantastic. Crew were proactive friendly chatty and present at all times. Very good experience!,1
I am an Altitude 50K member and have been for several years. I use Air Canada a lot. I swear it is the best airline in the Star Alliance and at least the Top 5 world wide. I traveled to Las Vegas this past weekend and was relegated to 'Rouge' because Air Canada does not fly there any longer. If you want to fly AC to Vegas - you must be rouged. The airfare (Flex) was more expensive (21% to be exact) then the Flex fare for September 2013. There are no amenities. No inflight entertainment. Oh sure you can watch a stream on your ipad or iphone - but there is no way to keep your device charged because in this the 21st Century some engineer decided there was no need for power supplies. Force people to watch on their electronic devices but don't allow them to charge. I used my upgrade points to 'Premium Economy' - although the ticketing laughingly refers to it as Business class. Seats are the same size as in economy no power no entertainment and yet - the same amount of credits are required. Thank god they at least had more leg room. But that's all they had. My food was adequate beverage service was slow and there are only 12 seats to serve. In the spring as I will be forced to Rouge again - and it will be the last and final time. I could go on but why bother. United Airlines here I come.,0
Our second trip travelling with Allegiant and for the most part we are happy with our flights to first Hawaii and now San Diego. However travelling from San Diego on April 20 we were concerned with the lack of communication about gate location. Since we printed the boarding passes the night before we expected no firm boarding gate at that time. When we arrived at the airport without checked in baggage we went directly through security as we usually do. However past security on the airport monitors there was no reference to our flight at all. All other airlines had the gate and time of departure clearly listed. We walked the airports 40 plus gates looking for any indication of which gate we should depart from. We then asked airport staff and they could only suggest we find an Allegiant agent which we could not. Again all other airlines were clearly provided with gate and departure time but not Allegiant. Finally we called Allegiant customer service and were on hold for 30 minutes. The person we finally talked to was after some delay was able to provide a preliminary gate assignment but suggested it might change. When we finally did find it even the monitor at the gate indicated gate closed. Rather than relaxing before our flight the time past security was quite stressful and at time we wondered whether we were at the right terminal. Communication is very important to passengers. All it would likely taken was a quick call the airport staff to get the monitor situation corrected. We will fly Allegiant again.,1
"Overall very satisfied with Air Berlin. Returned from a cruise which ended in Venice. First took a short flight to Dusseldorf to then catch the connection to JFK. All connections were made on time. The Air Berlin flight staff were all very congenial. Was able to watch three movies on their entertainment system to pass the time. Food was good. ""Open"" bar even better. I would definitely fly Air Berlin again.",1
PEN-SIN on a very new A320. Pre selected seat in the first row (1D) as I wanted to have a fast clearance out of Changi Airport. Aircraft was pushed back 10 minutes before ETD and arrived SIN 20 mins earlier than ETA. Efficient cabin crew.,1
Travelled Premium Economy on TOM046 from Gatwick to Sandford on 2 November 2013. Was scheduled to depart at 9.15 so checked in at 6.00 Checking in was excellent and we made our way to the NO 1 Lounge arriving shortly after 6.00. We had booked the lounge to hopefully start the journey in a relaxed way. At approx 8.30 we entered the main terminal to enquire about the obvious delay. There were no Thomson staff on duty at the information desk until 9.00 where a large number of disgruntled passengers had gathered. Â£5 vouchers were handed out but with no explanation for the delay. We then returned to the lounge but were only allowed to stay for the unexpired period of our 3 hours entitlement namely 30 minutes. We eventually departed at 13.00 having spent the remainder of the time in the far relaxed environment of the terminal building. We were not impressed by the over hyped Dreamliner and agree with the majority of points mentioned on this site. Due to Thomsons lack of customer care we will not be booking with Thomson again.,0
In December I flew from Zurich to Dubai. I was excited to fly the A380. However my excitement quickly turned into disappointment after experiencing the absolute crankiness of the cabin crew. Although never really rude the flight stewardesses were all very short and only busy with themselves. Their body language and facial expressions were often as if they'd rather be somewhere else and as if were a constant nuisance. The A380 (AMS-DUB) itself is a very nice plane spacious and modern. The onboard entertainment was pretty good and the extra touch were the cameras outside the plane so you could watch the outside surroundings from your screen in front of you. The return trip with a 777 was also disappointing. Emirates could not seat us together on the 6 hrs flight despite that we booked under the same booking reference number. Will never fly with them again unless I have no other option.,0
Perth-Johannesburg-Cape Town and return in Business. I was able to use the Qantas lounge at Perth airport. On the outward international A340 flight boarding was smooth; returning the boarding process at Johannesburg was slow due to Australian security requirements. The seats on the A340s were comfortable though the planes are showing their age. The outward Asian vegetarian meal was very bland; the meal loaded at Johannesburg was much better. The service was friendly in both directions. The two domestic flights in B737s were smooth and pleasant. The seats were comfortable and the food was fine. Overall SAA offers a good basic business class (no frills) and good value for money.,1
JFK-LHE-KHI. Good service comfortable 777 food was good. IFE and website/online booking and check-in really needs to be improved and was the only downside for me.,1
"SXF-CGN-SXF. I agree with the comment below about ""sharp practices"". The booking page gives a ""taxes and fees"" quote that is quite nice but if you should want a reserved seat that will be ??.95 each way sir. Oh you want to pay with a credit card on the internet?. Well we can do that but it will be ??.52 extra (?). Still it beat Air Berlin and the train by ??48 for a weekend trip so I will take my chances. It's my first time flying a Euro discounter and expect only to be taken from A to B in safety I guess",0
Hanoi-Hong Kong. Great cabin crew professional and courteous. Free newspapars great food and comfortable seating.,1
"Adult meals ran out, just sausage and potato left, no children's meals available! Return flight delayed by 7 hours as plane was not in a safe condition. Scheduled flight at 8pm departed at 3.30am! They had to fly one in to Orlando all the way from Cardiff - a bad joke. No children's meals available. ",0
My wife and I were on AC 590 from Phoenix to Toronto May 5 when we were told at check in that there were aircraft problems. Much later it came out that the plane was inoperable but instead of another AC plane they had to find a Rouge plane-which they did in San Diego so it went to Toronto then Phoenix so a 10 hour delay for us. The ground crew said they have fielded nothing but complaints since Rouge started. This was just the latest. I am a million mile for life AC client and my wife is super elite for the last 3 years. The Rouge experience is bad - no leg room limited overhead baggage room (more people same space) no entertainment system and every flight we have been on leaves late. It is the overhead baggage that creates the problems. At one point Rouge did not allow the same aeroplan point saving until clients complained and it was changed. Whoever came up with this concept did not consider their current clients. The price of tickets is the same and now Westjet will fly from Toronto to Phoenix beginning in the fall and they will take AC customers for sure. Rouge started with the short hauls and leg room can be tolerated for 2 hours but now they are on long hauls. Dressing the crew in designer clothing will not overcome these issues and in fact this situation is not fare to these staff and ground personal that are handling these complaints.,0
TLV-DXB-TLV via Amman and again the same good experience with RJ. All 4 flights exactly on time no issue with service on board although the movie selection is fairly limited. Food was good and legroom on A321 more than adequate. Amman airport is a breeze to transit through and RJ crown lounge comfortable although food selection is very very basic and internet can be unpredictable. The rate was so cheap in comparison with any other choice. RJ are a good dependable airline and my first choice for travel inside the Middle East. They beat Emirates and Etihad hands down on flights to the UAE. Highly recommend.,1
Guangzhou to Bangkok and on to Cairo as well as several domestic sectors within Egypt. Very poor customer service. Long delays with no help from ground staff or managers. Food and cabin crew attitude bad towards customers.,0
BMX-Paris. Very good service. Cabin crew were polite and attentive. Helped to find our connecting flight. No inflight entertainment but not an issue as was a very short flight. Seating was 3-3 across but were only the normal economy seats but had middle seat left empty and the armrests could be moved so not impressed by this. Food was very good and well presented. Felt service was what sold this flight to me. When traveling business with other airlines you can see the difference in seating. Liked the flight but would not recommend Air France over other airlines.,0
"The service was excellent, cabin crew attending to the passengers.  Our seats were comfortable and plenty of leg room. The meals on our outward flight were very good, also got sweets to eat for takeoff and landing and ice creams after the meal The only down side to our flight was the quality of the meal on our return journey - far inferior to the meal from London. Overall we were very happy with flight and would use Virgin Atlantic again. It was competitively priced with other airlines.",1
MLA to DGTE in June. Flight ended up being cancelled after 7 hours of waiting due to various unrecognizable reasons. We were already taxiing to the runway when the pilot decided to cancel the flight. Came back this month (September) and bought again a return ticket for MLA-DGTE-MLA. The outgoing flight went well although with the usual delay (2 hours) but on my return I decided to get an earlier flight from another airline because a day before the return trip I have been monitoring the airline's reliability and they were way off their declared schedules. Fearing I'd miss my international flight later that night I took the noon flight on another airline placing my afternoon flight with Air Philippines as backup. The other airline got me on time for my international flight and a phone call from my sister confirmed that I wouldn't have made it had I took Air Philippines as they arrived and left DGTE late again.,0
I flew from Vancouver to Taipei via Narita. The first part of the trip was pleasant entertainment was excellent but the food was poor but edible. Staff fluent in English and Japanese which was a big improvement since 2009. The second part of the trip was very hot and stuffy. Their food on the second leg was soggy and unpleasant to eat. I will definitely take this airline again.,1
I flew Stansted to Valencia. The queue for check in was disorganised but the staff were helpful and friendly. The plane was clean the staff were again helpful and friendly - particularly in helping elderly passengers to disembark - and I was happy with the service.,1
PUS-GMP 737-500. The weather was deteriorating and we were caught off guard by a typhoon heading our way. We got rebooked for free quick and friendly service. At the gate the flights would all be cancelled. The flight was bulk loaded pilots ready. The first delay occurred as extra service agents were called to the gate and were providing information to the passengers. After an hour delay we observed extra pilots boarding as well we learned the captain after deliberating safety being his major concern decided to fly out. A quick boarding nearly full flight and we took off in heavy winds and weather while dark. Despite the weather the pilot remarked thanking us for coming along for the ride saying Hang tight and nice flight which broke the tension. Even though it was a bumpy flight the crew were really calm and nice which calmed us all they spoke English too. It's times like this they must remain calm and they did. Not one time did we feel anything other than our safety was what was most important. A very capable and friendly airline.,1
Brussels-Rome-Athens Return. Staff were extremely rude even when both flights were delayed by more than 3 hours (also on the return). Very old planes and dirty (on both flights) and you get no food nor have the option to buy food. So we travelled hours without having the possibility to eat. You only get one coffee (half full) which is btw disgusting and you cannot ask for a refill. Would rather pay 200 euros more to go with another airline and even pay more and choosing Ryanair before them.,0
AK827 on 23/9 from Phuket to KL then KL to Sydney on 23/9 Flight D722. Return was on D223 Sydney to KL on 7/10 then same date KL to Phuket on AK222. I booked well in advance for a trip to Sydney via Kuala Lumpur and am a frequent flyer with Aisr Asia so am aware of the restrictions for the excellent price and service which is provided. I would have liked to have been informed that there was no Business Class Lounge at Kuala Lumpur airport and also it would have helped if they had given us some idea of the great distance between Gates. I cannot fault their service at the desks through the Gates and on the aircraft. Business Class is extremely comfortable and with the exception of the food and beverage arrangement which I was aware of very good.,1
Flew on Dreamliner Melbourne to Brunei. Flight departed late due to airport only using one runway. Spent 90 mins on tarmac waiting to take off. Biz class cabin has only 3 rows. Seat was comfortable enough and the provision of a large pillow was great for sleeping. Service was excellent food was equal to other airlines and IFE adequate for all but avid movie buffs. Missed my connection in Brunei due to delay in Melb. Was met on arrival guided through immigration and sent to hotel for overnight stay. Flight to KL the next day was equally as good.,1
"I had multiple instances of stress while flying with Spirit. 1) The tickets look cheap but they quickly make up for that cost by charging ridiculous prices for bags (total of $150 for one checked back and one carry-on for the trip). 2) Since they are such a small operation it means they have a very limited number of planes, crews, and flights. This results in flight delays as well as trip delays (when I missed my flight due to the security lines) the next available flight was the next day. The cherry on top of that was that the next morning's flight was delayed. My return flight was also delayed, I spent more time in the airport over the weekend than I did at Myrtle Beach. 3) Because of high costs, stress and delays there are a large number of unhappy customers and as a result the Spirit staff is harried and unhelpful when you have an issue. Don't get me wrong, I tend to be a very thrifty person, but paying another $200 for convenience to fly a bigger airline is worth it.",0
ORY-EWR first time using Open Skies. I didn't know about the airlines until I was told by my travel agent that it offers value for money. Was told that it was all business class but when I boarded it was obvious that my seat and the amenity kit given were inferior from those at the front of the aircraft. The food and service were OK and although the airline is operated by BA I think BA's business class service is better and the FAs are more attentive. But of course I suppose you have to pay premium for that.,1
I recently returned from a round-trip from Charlotte-Rochester NY with change of planes in Dulles on the outbound and Newark on the inbound. The trip was fine. Flight attendants on all flights were very professional. Ticketing crew in Charlotte and Rochester were nice. I used the lounge in Newark and was pleasantly surprised. Food was limited to snacks but that was to be expected (why US airlines do not have lounges with food selections akin to those of international airlines is beyond me). But two unexpected plusses were the presence of showers (which I did not use) and free alcoholic beverages (albeit of limited varieties). Still the lounge was a pleasant alternative of the hub-bub of Newark. I am a fan of propeller planes and was not disappointed. Both flights in and out of Rochester were on props. I will fly United again.,1
We flew from Sudbury to Ottawa and then on to Santa Maria Cuba on Jan 20th. Flight was on time and service so good. We even got to Cuba 30 mins early. So no complaints for this trip.,1
LHR - BKK return. Managed to sleep approx. 7 hours on the outward flight food and drink adequate but nothing special. Its a shame that the seats do not convert to fully flat but our flight price was reasonable staff and service were good. The return flight was pretty uneventful food and drink quality and availability are just OK (the cheese platter is very poor) staff again helpful and friendly. Sadly Thai are not quite up to the standard they were a few years ago.,1
From Chicago to Hong Kong - the airlines bumped me to Business Class which was great. Hong Kong to Perth sat in purchased premium economy awful! Service was worse than any economy flight I've flown! Meat was so tough I had to shred it and attendants never came by to provide drinks during meal so I had the half cup of warm water! They served 1/2 cup of coffee well after the meal and never returned to offer more cups were still at my seat when the next meal was served! The flight was not full so economy passengers were stretched out to sleep by putting up arm rests which cannot be done in premium economy due to trays being stored in the arm rests. Seats are difficult to push back for anyone not weighing much such as me! So either pay for business class or settle for economy! Staff never strolled through cabin to see if anyone needed anything.,1
HKG - Bangkok economy. Flight out a bit late but made up time on way. Newish plane good AVOD and food. Usual efficient and friendly service from CX. Return also good. Good meal choices service with a smile large wines given quickly and all in all very impressive. Only down was landing at gate 65 which is possibly the furthest gate ever!,1
Outbound 03/11/2013 ET701 LHR-ADD 11K. Was flying home very last minute as my mother died very suddenly. The Dnata ground crew were great on check in and gave me a quiet seat as requested. I had to travel with assistance as was meant to start chemo on 04/11/2013 and all was okay until an hour after take off. I went to the loo and found about 20 people waiting the reason three toilets were broken on board leaving only four for over 200 pax! On arrival at ADD no wheelchair and we disembarked via stairs Left on tarmac waiting for bus for 20 mins. At the terminal I was told to find my own wheelchair. On boarding my flight to Ndola ET871 the escalator was broken so was carried down backwards. Lift to plane was broken so had to wait to board and was last on. Again crew were great. 12/11/2013 ET871 NLA-ADD and ET700 ADD-LHR. Flight 871 was fine but again on arrival at ADD no wheelchair. The cabin crew off 871 ended up finding me a wheelchair and wheeling me themselves. After complaining I was allowed me to use the business class lounge for my 5 hour transit. All I needed was to be able to sit in a quiet place. On boarding ET700 I found the seat to be broken and very uncomfortable. The crew were great but in the end they are let down by ageing 767 300ERs that have seen better days. It was like flying in the 80's especially as there was only overhead TV entertainment showing French films to and from London!,0
Rome-Manila via Riyadh and Jeddah on return flight. Tickets are cheap but the trip is challenging. Starting from the long queue at check-in in Rome. First leg was ok except for entertainment which is far below standard. Vegetarian food was quite good toilets ok with a variety of cologne hand cream etc. Good travel kit. Stopover in Riyadh - airport is a nightmare with no shops. Riyadh-Manila - toilets barely had soap and towels. Return Manila-Jeddah-Rome was a nightmare. Manila-Jeddah delayed 5 hrs. They provided food but nothing for vegetarians so I had to buy food. Arrived in Jeddah where staff were unfriendly.,0
My wife and I booked a round trip to Cancun. Turns out Westjet is a rather ordinary airline with the usual amenities. We travel at least twice a year and have flown with several airlines and Westjet is just another hohum get to the destination boring company. I think they have lost their uniqueness in a big way.,0
In March 2014 I booked a flight from San Diego to Vancouver BC. There was a one hour stop-over with plane change at LAX. Between that booking and the flight date of November 30th Delta made 6 changes/cancellations to this single reservation resulting in the change in planes being switched to Seattle with a 4 hour stop-over. When my flight arrived in Seattle a further one hour delay was announced. I asked the reason and was told that it was because of ice despite the fact that it was a sunny day with dry pavement everywhere and the plane was coming from Las Vegas. The clerk then mentioned that Delta did not offer compensation for weather-related delays. The lie about icing was confirmed by another clerk who checked in her computer and found the delay was really caused by mechanical failure. I then asked what compensation Delta would give me for a 5 hour stop-over involving dinner time. I was offered a chocolate bar. Delta is the last airline I would choose in the future.,0
22nd Feb 2014 arrived in London Gatwick at 11am for our 1.30pm flight to Dubai to be told that the flight was delayed by 6 hours and would not take off until 7pm. Staff at Gatwick and on the flight were unable to give us any information about our connecting flights to India. Landed in Dubai at 6am on 23rd Feb and although all passengers on the flight had missed their connections there were no ground staff waiting to direct us. Asked to go to the transit desk found more than 500 people crowded into a small space with no proper queue. Only 2 Emirates staff were available. We stood for 4.5 hours with no refreshments. Communication was very poor and we had no idea how long the wait would be. At 10.30 am staff started directing passengers to different gates depending on their destination. We sat until 5.30 pm with no information as to which flight we were likely to catch. Although they handed out food vouchers at 2.30pm they ran out so not everyone got vouchers. At 5.30pm we were finally given boarding cards for the 9.45 pm connecting flight to Trivandrum. Although we waited 16 hours in the airport Emirates were unable to offer us a hotel room or even a lounge. Finally arrived at our destination at 3.45 am on 24th Feb. We appreciate that delays due to bad weather are unavoidable. However Emirates had 24 hours notice after the fog on Saturday morning and did nothing to prepare for the chaos on Sunday. Communication was extremely poor.,0
Vilnius to Leeds/Bradford Oct 18th. My complaint is about the airport departure experience. Being a party of 5 with a baby we paid for priority boarding. What this meant in practice was that we had the pleasure (!) of standing at the head of a queue for about 75 minutes. The flight was about 30 mins late arriving and departing which must have been known by the departure gate staff yet they made no attempt deal with the queue that formed either by telling people to go and sit down while waiting or delaying checking people through the gate. I have written to Ryanair but am awaiting a response as I write. I can't rubbish them completely as the flight was relatively comfortable and onboard staff were quite pleasant. I understand Ryanair is to introduce a policy of seat allocation this should stop a lot of the problem we experienced though not the part where airport gate staff let passengers through the gate over half an hour before departure.,0
We travelled first class Sydney to Paris via Abu Dhabi and return in September/October. We had 2 previous experiences with Etihad on this same flight both in Business Class. The first time in 2009 was excellent. Service meals attention to detail was second to none. The second trip was a little less so less attentive the calibre of meals had deteriorated somewhat and service was definitely in decline. So this time we thought we would go First Class. Such a disappointment. From the check in at Sydney Airport - where apart from not being in a queue we could have been anyone for the level of attention and reception received. Thank heavens for the Express Passes to get us quickly through customs and immigration. The cabins in First were excellent the flat beds long and as comfortable as you could get and the beds were made up with sheets. Cabin crew were efficient but certainly lacked the warmth of previous flights. The chefs advised that they could prepare anything for us where in fact the meals were very ordinary and unimaginative. It also took a long time to be served. I know they were striving for a 'dining experience' but when you are tired and hungry you don't want to wait nearly 4 hours as we did on our flight home. I also don't want to hear how tired the staff are how busy they are or any other excuses as we did on several flights. I think we have given Etihad every chance to prove themselves but we may not fly with them again.,0
CZ3189 from Shenzhen to Beijing on April 2nd. The weather in Shenzhen was terrible. I was told the flight would be delayed for almost 4 hours. Fortunately while I was staying in the lounge the ground staff were very patient and nice. They kept me informed of the latest information on my flight every half hour until take off. Although my flight was delayed I believe I still will choose China Southern next time.,1
"This is the second time we booked Air Canada and was bumped to Rouge. We paid for Air Canada and got its cousin Rouge. As a Super Elite (MM) member I was outraged that Air Canada has the arrogance to throw 5 members of my family on this 3rd world service. Seat too small flight attendants were mostly arrogant and ignorant except for one mid cabin FA. Can't charge a phone uniforms look like they are out of a bad movie. I'll be using Westjet for any flights that are not guaranteed ""Air Canada"" or Jazz.",0
4 of us flew Glasgow to Sanford in Premium. Reading earlier reviews I was apprehensive as it has been a long time since I booked a holiday airline. Quite a surprise. 787 was great and the captain was obviously proud on the outbound flight going into some details about this particular aircraft. The cabin crew worked extremely hard constantly in the cabin with food snacks and drinks. Unlike other carriers the crew did not vanish. Movie choice was good for the duration of the flight. Same high quality experience on the flight home. Sanford airport is very small but the benefits are obvious and on a holiday worth the trade off for expanded facilities. I would not hesitate to book with Thomson on this route/holiday again.,1
LAX-Narita-Hanoi and would not go on JAL again. One reviewer commented on how warm the flight was and I couldn't agree more so warm I was going crazy and switched into some shorts from my carry on. Poor service as they seem to be catering to those who were Japanese. Entertainment system was old and filled with older movies and few new releases. They got me back alive and in one piece but would not take them again.,0
"LGK-SIN. No frills as expected aircraft was clean service efficient flight delayed 30 minutes but made up some time in its turnaround at LGK. A320 seats were rather cramped with minimal legroom for an average sized ""westerner"". Some English cabin announcements were very difficult to understand.",1
I flew Air Canada Rouge and was appalled at how cramped the seats are. They are narrow and so close to the seat in front I don't know how a tall person could even fit their legs in. Or travel for longer than the 3 hours I did. Not comfortable. The flight attendants were very friendly and competent.,0
Ethiopian airlines is terrible with consistent delays never making any announcements. After more than two hours of waiting for our flight it was a pleasant surprise that we got their new long-haul 787 Dreamliner on this relatively short 120 min flight from Arusha to Addis Ababa. Didn't have time to test out everything but I love the Dreamliner and its spacious 2-2-2 interior. Was great to get full-service on this short flight.,1
My husband and I were very impressed with Singapore Airlines. The cabin crew were polite professional and attentive during the flight. I was impressed with how they kept the bathrooms clean during the flight always with a smile on their faces. The food was very good - we were in economy plus and very impressed with all meals. While the uniforms are beautiful I did wonder how they would perform in any emergency of vacating the plane. We would definitely fly Singapore Airlines again.,1
SUB-SIN return. Outbound in Y Class. Departed on time cabin crew friendly food was fine. We arrived in Singapore ahead of schedule. Inbound in C Class. Late evening departure but was delayed 30 mins. Pre take- off drinks were served immediately. Seats are lie-flat and pretty comfortable cabin crew attentive and polite food was tasty. Our luggage was on the carousel very quickly.,1
During the recent Cairo unrest my daughter was refused checking by BMI staff on the basis she was not a British National. She was not alone. I wrote to BMI seeking an explanation. BMI response was a letter stating that due to heavy workload resulting from the snow storms in December (two months earlier) they would not be investigating the matter. I have never been so badly treated and feel dismissed and angered by this non response.,0
BOM-LKO. Flew on Indigo thrice and all 3 flights were delayed. Paid extra to book seat of choice and meal. Check-in staff extremely rude and unfriendly. Cabin was not as clean as they rave about. Inflight cabin service without a smile. Only cold meals served. They also charge for wheelchairs with fares comparable to full service carriers. Not my choice and not recommended. Very pricey for a 'low cost airline'.,0
"I bought direct return flights a year ahead of time (YUL-CUN). I paid full fare. Without warning Air Canada re- routed me through YYZ and downgraded me to Air Canada Rouge. On the return flight I was also downgraded to Air Canada Rouge without any compensation whatsoever. On top of it the state-of-the-art wireless entertainment system didn't work and on the return flight we found out that the ""state-of-the-art"" wireless entertainment system doesn't even support the latest Windows 8.1 operating system. You should also know that the seats are extremely uncomfortable narrow and with little leg-room. The service was basic including incomprehensible French announcement (flight out of Toronto). On the return flight (direct to YUL) the flight attendants in economy didn't speak French but one. This simple fact increases risk in case of an emergency. Clearly Air Canada is reducing service and security (low cost) while maintaining full fare. It is a lost-lost for all travellers. Avoid Air Canada Rouge!",0
SAN-PHX roundtrip. The flight from SAN to PHX was delayed at the gate for 40 minutes in San Diego. The plane however was a new refurbished looking 737-700. Very comfortable. The flight back was on an old worn looking 737-300. The flight was a little bumpy to begin with but it got smoother as we went along. We arrived on time at the gate in SAN. Cabin crew were friendly both ways.,1
"I was nervous after reading the reviews but everything was ok. Plane was new and we arrived on time. Cabin crew were nice but they don't speak much English. Given bread, juice and coffee for free. Great comfort for a good price.",1
Have taken two flights to South America with Iberia the food is dreadful and lack of inflight entertainment is unacceptable in these modern planes. I found the Spanish crew on all the flights very rude but the English crew couldn't do enough for you. There are some pluses: the planes were on time good connection times and the seats are comfortable. The prices are far cheaper than the other airlines and for me the advantages outweigh the disadvantages so much I'm back to South America again with Iberia next year!,1
"MAA-HYD. The crews are friendly the airplanes clean they still run a largely on-time operation and prices remain very affordable. The bad news is the pains associated with flying ""ultra low cost carriers"" are now beginning to inflict the airline. Seat selection was free the last time I flew them a couple of years ago but now they charge Rs. 100 per passenger. They also charge Rs. 50 to get a copy of your e-ticket at the airport. Neither one of those really bother me though. What does bother me is the bogus Rs. 200 ""convenience fee"" that you now have to pay to book online a fee that isn't disclosed until you get to the very last screen before payment. Even worse if you have to make a change to your reservation the ""convenience fee"" is charged every time you make a change. IndiGo is unfortunately picking up the bad habits of the Spirits and Ryanairs of the world though at least the service is very good for now anyway.",1
We travelled from KUL-ALA-LHR-ALA-KUL earlier this month. We were very pleasantly surprised by the high standard of service and attention given by the cabin crew on all sectors. The aircraft was reassuringly up to date and instead of built in entertainment system had iPad movies/TV at least in Business Class which anyway give a much better picture (and the choice of music is excellent too!). Quality of onboard food out of Almaty was a bit iffy however understood when one takes into account one is in Central Asia. This airline is a little gem and excellent value for money.,1
"Check in is effective and quite fast. Crew onboard is also very effective. The biggest problem with Dragonair is the flight is delayed hence we got very late to Hong Kong. However Dragonair organized a pick up service at the gate and bring you directly to the gate for the next flight on time, but in most of the cases, the luggage will not come with you on time and may be delivered 1 day later at the final destination.",1
JFK-RDU: First time flying this carrier. They have a nice terminal in JFK but the security line takes a long time to get through took 40min. Staff were very friendly and kept you abreast of the flight situation even when everything was going fine. Takes a long time to taxi at JFK with all of the flights but this is not airline's fault. Seat space was excellent for both the ER190 going out and the A320 return. Didn't use the inflight entertainment as the flight was only an hour so no need to. The giving out of free snacks and drinks is nice along with the free first checked bag. I will definitely use them again.,1
I first flew Spirit in November 2013 on a return trip to and from Cancun Mexico. Booked on Spirit after coming across the cheap prices on Kayak. I went to the airport ready to do battle but much to my surprise I was quickly processed through there were no surprise extra costs and the flights were in fact uneventful. I again flew last week to and from San Diego and the experience was the same. Yes I wish they had better seats with more leg room and perhaps provide some sustenance during the flight but I guess one has to prepare for lack of such amenities when flying budget. Would I fly with them again? Yes I would. During the four flights I had with Spirit I saw the ground/airport crew work overtime to make sure that we did not miss the connecting flights when there were delays sometimes personally escorting/directing the passengers through the maze of airport hubs and the on-air crews were always pleasant.,1
Not worth flying Rouge unless you are small in stature. Disappointingly tight legroom. Actually laughed when I got to my seat and saw how little legroom there was and then cried when the person in front of me reclined their seat into my knees. First time I ever had my 11 year old daughter commenting how cramped the seats were. Although the flights were cheap there were comparable deals available for the same itineraries with better comfort levels. Booked as codeshare on United and tried to reserve seats in advance but was unable to so. Very long holds on the phone with AC (30 minutes excellent deterrent). As a Star Alliance Gold was disappointed with this level of service. Everything else was roughly as expected. Will make a point of avoiding Rouge in the future.,0
SYD-DPS Executive Class. First time flying with Garuda. The immigration on board saved lots of time and queuing on arrival. Food entertainment system staff seat A330 plane all excellent. Flight attendants seemed to walk through the cabin every 30 seconds checking on everyone. Lay flat seat got me a couple of hours sleep.,1
BGY-OTP and back. The first bad remark is about the website: slow complicated and inefficient. In Milan Bergamo the boarding was fair and those who booked and paid for their seat like me were allowed to board first. B737 is very old but the legroom better than Ryanair and the seat relatively comfortable. The crew were quite young but not very friendly. On the way back the boarding in Bucharest was chaotic and many people were trapped by an employee who checked the dimension of all baggage. Many were forced to pay 55 euros to load the luggage and very intense discussions took place between some passengers and the employees. In short flights were ok and we arrived on time on both legs. However they have to improve their ground services improve the website and make in sort to have a more friendly staff.,0
"Not sure why Qantas decided to partner with Emirates - terrible deal for Qantas customers! Travelling from Dubai to New York on the A380 I bought paid for the WiFi access and used it for about 5 minutes before it went off. When I complained to the onboard service director she told me that Emirates was not responsible for the service and that I needed to write to ""inner"" the service provider. This was absolutely shocking - in my opinion Emirates is responsible for every service offered on it's flights. Also flying from LHR to Dubai on a night flight my seat was damaged and wouldn't recline so having paid for a first class seat I was unable to get a nights rest (the aircrew told me that they knew the seat was damaged before the flight left but that the engineer was unable to fix it). The flight was full so I was unable to be relocated but I would have preferred to have been given the choice of another flight - this is what Qantas would have done. Put simply I believe that Emirates have placed far too much emphasis on growth and not enough on keeping customers happy. Given the available alternatives and the cost of air tickets I for one will not be flying Emirates anymore.",0
Flew from Rio/GIG to CDG last month. Selected the option for a seat plus on the upper deck of the 747-400. This gives you additional leg room and a smaller cabin so in my view worth the extra money. Crew were excellent on this trip friendly and chatty. Food was good. For me the seat became very uncomfortable after 4 hours. I have travelled many times with Air France over the years and the crews can be very hit and miss. This crew were one of the best.,1
Paris to Lima in Business because of their unbeatable price and pleasantly surprised by the level of service. CDG-MAD a codeshare by Air France whose Business Class service is below all standards just normal economy. Business lounge in Madrid is very basic but onboard young and cheerful crew who were attentive and smiling. Excellent meals with Spanish flavours and some of their best wines. Comfortable reclining seats allowed a nice sleep. Similarly pleasant experience on the return flight.,1
YYZ-HEL-ARN-HEL-YYZ. Boeing 757-200 between Toronto-Helsinki. I am aware that other airlines also use these smaller Boeings for equivalent routes between these smaller European capitals and US. It was first time I flew this type of aircraft on a transatlantic flight. I found it to be small packed and the fact that there was barely any inflight entertainment system on board didn't maker the 8-9 hr flight between Toronto and Helsinki any better. The flight itself was however very smooth and Helsinki airport is excellent for someone who likes quick and efficient transfers.,0
ZRH-JFK v.v. Food was fantastic and excellent service. Seat for outbound flight was very comfortable. Inbound flight was upgraded to First class seat - excellent experience.,1
Belgrade-Dubai-Muscat on 2 Nov 2012. At the time of checking-in / boarding in Belgrade I was informed that my booked flight Dubai-Muscat was cancelled and I got a boarding pass for a later flight which was not acceptable. Informed that flight was cancelled due to ?economic reasons??(not enough passengers?). E-mail from Flydubai informing about my options sent too late. Upon arrival to Dubai airport there was nothing I could do had to purchase a ticket to Muscat for the first available flight much more expensive of course. Flydubai is not a ?low cost??company at all if you add baggage drinks terrible conditions at Flydubai building at Dubai airport etc. + high risk of cancellation you get almost the same price as any other ?normal??company.,0
Flight from ICN to HKG. 12 hour delay. But hotel provided. The 787 was a wonderful aircraft with plenty of legroom. Unfriendly cabin crew they never smiled and they seemed tired.,1
US Airways 502 and 1836 on July 21st 2014. Having read the reviews on this site I became quite nervous about flying with US Airways! What were they going to do to me? To my luggage? What lies would they make up? So happy to say I had a completely non-eventful perfectly normal flight with pleasant flight attendants punctual timing useful information and all my baggage arriving on time and in good condition. Better legroom than some airlines I've been on. Helpful friendly people all through. Twice we were served beverages - no food so that might be my only gripe but it's a small one really. I think it's important to write a review even when things go well to counteract all the bad ones on here. Flight from Mexico City to Las Vegas via Phoenix.,1
Flew on 29/05/15 from Gatwick to Las Vegas. Check in process was fine. Upon boarding I noticed 2-3 police waiting at the gate watching passengers enter not in itself out of the norm but when they proceeded to board the aircraft and walk up and down the aisles it was slightly unnerving to say the least. The food was average at best but the actions of certain crew had me amazed. I was sat on one side of the galley and on the other side a stag group of about 9-12 guys. Throughout the flight there was constant bad language which was not once addressed by the crew even with small children only a couple of rows back. It seemed that two young female members of the crew seemed to think they were on a social night out with the guys from the stag do and spent most of the flight sat in the galley talking to them allowed them to help themselves to the drinks! Later one of the crew went to the Business class cabin loaded a plate of cheese and biscuits and brought it back to the galley for the hungry stags to feast on. Absolutely shocking professionalism from certain staff.,0
"US Airways itself was not too bad. The problem was the smaller airlines they contract to. Boston to DC (Reagan) - not too bad was on time at least. DC to Chicago - delayed but no idea why. Sat in Chicago for 2 hours boarded deplaned boarded again - they ""couldn't find the pilot"". Finally got to Des Moines. Two days later Des Moines to Charlotte - delayed no idea why. While waiting for my carry-on to be retrieved from ""valet checking"" so I could make my connection to Philadelphia the gate attendant was quite rude when I asked the status of my connection. Ran through the airport to make the connection then sat on the plane for 30 minutes. Was also told that I would need to check my carry-on because there was ""no room"" in the overhead compartment. When I boarded most of the overhead compartments were open - several were empty most were less than half full. Had to collect bag from baggage claim when I got to Philadelphia but at least I didn't have to pay for it. Philadelphia to Boston was slightly delayed because of a check engine light that came on after we were all boarded. They did manage to get maintenance in fairly quickly and apparently got the problem resolved - but this was US Air not a smaller airline. I'm going back to Southwest and Jet Blue - cheaper more reliable more customer oriented and they keep better track of their pilots.",0
I recently flew business class from London to Lagos and then on to Asaba. I hadn't previously heard of Arik usually preferring BA. However the Arik price was more than half the BA price and also had the guaranteed connections from Lagos. The business class product is impressive - the beds are better than BA and the cabin feels a lot more spacious (including a bar where you can go to sit). The cabin crew were also very friendly. The internal flights were both delayed because of the weather - this was dealt with well by the Arik staff. Though the inflight entertainment is not too good and the customer service is not quite up to the BA / Virgin standard I was still impressed with Arik and would certainly fly with them again.,1
DME-HKG-DME. Fully satisfied with the flight. Check-in was very efficient staff very professional and polite. No delays both flights arrived actually 15 minutes earlier. Well-balance food on board. Excellent entertainment system with vast selection of movies & music. Great in-flight magazine with lots of useful tips on Hong Kong and interesting articles about other countries. The seats are a little bit funny but when you get used to them they are pretty comfortable indeed. Great value for money and comfort.,1
BKK-KUL-SIN-KUL-SIN in Business. Great value for money. Service from check-in staff and on-board was just excellent.,1
"San Jose (SJC) to Santa Ana (SNA) return. For both flights checking in on-line 24 hours before each flight got me an ""A25"" or better boarding pass and on both flights I was able to get a window seat on the over-wing emergency exit row with lots of leg room. On the flight to SNA the flight attendant spent quite a bit of time going over the emergency exit procedures which I think was a great example of how this airline can be both professional (take care of serious business) and laid back (announcements are usually quite funny and entertaining!). Soft drinks and peanuts served on these 1-hour flights and two suitcases checked in free.",1
Thomson Flights say they offer 'Great customer service'. Not in my experience. Upon arriving at the check in desk at Stansted I got no words of welcome no pleasantries at all. A cold reception and unhelpful and unfriendly staff. I was left alone at the departure gate still awaiting the pre booked special assistance. I never got to venture inside the lounge I had paid for it was an awful experience for my very first visit to Stansted Airport. To top it all I was forced to pay almost Â£120 in excess luggage fees. I was told both check in staff 'I could throw away what I don't need there are bins dotted all around the airport'.,0
Berlin - Madeira - Berlin. Very friendly crew on both flights including regular updates on flight status. Compared to Germanwings all passengers still get free drinks (2 rounds alcoholic beverages are not included) a rather tasty sandwich and then some chocolate later. Space is also ok. So while the service has declined over the years (no more free magazines) Air Berlin still offers better service than most other charter carriers plus the friendly staff made both flights very enjoyable. The only thing I would criticise is that although they show even a movie on this flight you need to purchase headsets which in the end nobody did (yes they are only 3 Euro but giving those out for free would be nice).,1
DEL-HEL-HEL. October 2012. Finnair uses leased A340s from Air France on this sector and it is very visible with the blue tray table and leg rests. Efficient check in and boarding. Finnair is strict on weight of cabin baggage - they actually checked it. During the Delhi - Helsinki flight an additional round of drinks were served between the two meals which was welcome. Crew seemed friendly and efficient but not as warm as other airlines. Quality of food was very low - greasy and small in quantity probably because Finnair sells snacks in between meals. Return flight of six hours in the night was packed and crew did 4 hours of service for dinner and breakfast interspersed with announcements so ensured passengers did not get sleep. Cabin lights were not dimmed prior to take off and during landing. Average airline and not the best. Helsinki Vantaa airport was a breeze.,0
"Luang Prabang to Hanoi HuÃ© to HCMC both A321. New aircraft. Flights on time friendly crew clean aircraft and good info from the cockpit. Attention to safety procedures. No IFE but magazines surprisingly good. I lost my credit card on the flight and the friendly ground staff went the extra mile to retrieve it for me in good humour. The Luang Prabang flight had a snack listed but it was just a non-alcoholic drink. Only water on the short HuÃ© flight but it cost so little that anything else would have been worth 10% of the flight price. VN definitely belong to the family of ""good"" Asian airlines.",1
City jet flights in France on behalf of Air France. Very impolite and icy cabin personnel. For a flight of Air France within France Cityjet (as a subsidiary of Air France) refuses to speak French whereas the flight is domestic! Most people using Air France for domestic flights in France don't care whether the flight is pure Air France or subsidiary Irish City Jet - but they don't speak english and they don't expect an Air France flight to be only in english (especially safety announcements).,0
Flying to Guam on board their A330 punctuality of the flight very good and the pre-flight service nice. Cabin crew are all friendly and smile throughout. Personal entertainment includes some great films and games but the meal service is nothing special. Would fly again.,1
I travelled from Mangalore to Mumbai on 28 December. Flight was delayed 20 minutes and we were promptly alerted of this at Mangalore airport. Check in was smooth and I received the seating of my choice. Boarding was chaotic. One Air India ground staff member announced that boarding would commence for rows 1 to 15 while another commented that boarding would start from rows 16 onwards. This obviously resulted in a confused queue of people. The welcome on board was pretty average however the seating (comfort and leg space) was just fantastic a luxury I had not experienced with other airlines lately. Only tea/coffee cookies and a bottle of water was served which is really appalling given that this is a 12:50 pm departure. Thankfully I had carried a sandwich with me as I had read about the cookies in another review. Flight was delayed 30 minutes overall however there was no announcement made by the captain nor any other announcements about arrival in Mumbai the weather etc. Overall disappointing except for the comfortable seating.,0
I have used KLM several times now and reasonably pleased with the service provided. The entertainment system has a long list of good movies and seat comfort is good even with my glass back though it could improve with the addition of a foot rest. An extra tour with the beverage trolley would be nice on long-haul flights but you can always buzz if necessary. Planes are always clean and tidy. Cabin staff are pleasant. But the best part about KLM? Using Schipol Airport.,1
Flight from Nagoya to Shanghai. 3 hours delay without any compensation. No passenger communication at all from the ground staff at Nagoya. While seated in the aircraft next to an emergency exit. A male flight attendant tells me the emergency briefing of Not to touch the emergency door! The flight was set for 2.5 hours from this we had constant 2 hours of moderate turbulence - what bothered me the most was that the flight crew did not even once speak with the passages explaining the situation on why and the probable estimation of the turbulence. The cabin temperature was set extremely high. An overall rating for this quick flight. A full nightmare from arrival at the China Eastern counter until leaving the airport with my bags at my destination. This company has zero customer care and support.,0
We travelled out to Iceland in April 2012. On the way out the aircraft was nearly full however Icelandair had made good use of the seats available. Unfortunately this could not be said on our return trip. We had booked in online and given seats near the front of the aircraft. The flight was called and we gave our tickets to board. The lady said we had a seat change. We got our seats where a gentleman said the seat between us was his! What made me upset was the aircraft was full. Instead of moving people around as in the first flight the first of 10 row had only 6 people in it. Know the front 2 rows of seat are bigger however the remaining seat were the same size with only a curtain as separation which can be moved. Icelandair need to have a think about all its passengers comfort.,0
Very happy to write a quick follow up to my recent review indicating that my good experience was not a fluke. LA- Kona first class on a 757. I was served a decent meal by an extremely pleasant crew including the signature sundae. Everything was crisp and professional with a touch of warm. Same comments about sad entertainment system though.,1
Egypt to Germany with a stop in Bucharest. Food was horrible I smelt the pork sausage before I saw it. As a Muslim I cannot eat this and there was no other choice. Asking the staff what kind of meat this was they told me its chicken. Very dull flight without entertainment whatsoever as there were no headphones.,0
Flew from Rome to Toronto. Air Hostess - unfriendly. They do not respond to individual calls. You have to get up and walk to the front or to the back of the airplane if you need water. I travelled with an infant when I asked for some milk one air hostess bluntly said no. Another was good enough to accept the bottle and asked for my seat number. However most of them were grumpy and look annoyed. Entertainment - No personal entertainment No power No USB. There are TVs at the centre which play videos. Most TVs were not functioning properly some screens were in mono color. Transport to Airplane - on crowded buses. So unorganized that passengers were asked to stay inside the bus for a long time after the bus had reached the plane. I do not recommend.,0
LHR-SYD Economy class with my husband and 22 month old son. Checked in 2 hrs prior to departure after 30 minutes in line we found we had been assigned seats in different rows. We boarded only to sit on the tarmac for an hour. After take off my son became ill I pressed the buzzer for help and the stewardess arranged to get him to the medical centre in the airport after disembarking. When getting back on the flight we saw 3 side seats free however just before we took off another couple swapped their seats and took them. My husband had no inflight entertainment and it was unable to be fixed. As the plane began to descend into Sydney we were moved to Business class (which was 75% empty) so that quarantine could talk to us before we got off the plane. I can safely say that after my nearly 15 years in the travel industry I have never experienced such bad service.,0
Hong Kong to London in World. It was on the A380 - first time aboard and must say I was impressed. A much better experience than the Emirates A380. Great mood lighting large windows. Nice to have a number of small cabins on both decks. Friendly service from the crew.,1
St. Louis to Orlando via Charlotte. First flight left late and they made no effort to hold our connecting flight (on the same carrier). Provided no information on gate changes and we missed our meetings. Got up at 3am only to end cooling our heels in Charlotte all day. Will never book with them again.,0
On 28th July flew from Edinburgh to Gatwick. Flight was delayed 3 hours as it had been hit by lightening on the flight this we accepted but what happened afterwards means I will never use them again. 1) Information or details of what was happening had to bedraggled out of them. 2) At no time was any refreshment offered. 3) The flight was further delayed to allow people to transfer back onto this flight when they choose to be transferred to a later flight rather than wait to see what was happening this lead to a further delay of 1 hour. 4) No breakfast or snack was served for health and safety reasons. 5) Although they stated we would be well hydrated during the flight only one drink service was provided this consisted of 4 fluid oz cup of water between 7.00am and 2.30pm. 6) They then proceeded to leave our luggage at Edinburgh while we travelled to Gatwick. 7) After giving us the run around for an hour and a half they then decided to tell us they could not track our bags. 8) It then took them two days to locate them and send them from Edinburgh to Gatwick. Would I use again or recommend - never in a month of Sundays.,0
LHR-BKK return. Easy check-in no problem with seating and had the seats requested. Staff very attentive onboard - they brought drinks round every 30mins. Food was good with a variety of drinks offered including alcohol. On BKK-LHR two full meals served. Inflight entertainment covered a range of options while not as comprehensive as Emirates ICE system there was a good choice of viewing.,1
Flew from UK to Sri Lanka with change in Kuwait. I chose the airline based on price but as the tickets were only Â£80 less each than Emirates this was a real false economy and one I regret. Where to start old dirty plane unexplained delays in Kuwait legroom bordering on illegal in-flight entertainment totally absent uninterested staff (except one attendant on return flight who was exception to the rule) food ok although no alcohol. During the night flight the lights were not turned down and people were aloud to wander from their seats to have communal chats so it was impossible to sleep.,0
On the flight from JFK to Rome the inflight entertainment didn't work (staff didn't seem that interested in doing anything about it) the food was the worst airline food I have had in years and the seats were very uncomfortable. The next flight from Rome to Tel Aviv was equally as bad and involved the most disorganized boarding process with people boarding from both ends of the plane with no rhyme or reason. On all of the flights the staff seemed generally disinterested.,0
SFO-IAD-SFO on 2/6/13 and 2/13/13. Great flights both ways. Early arrivals at both Dulles and SFO. Flight attendants were courteous positive and helpful. Seats were comfortable. Baggage came out on carousel at SFO quicker than I expected or had experienced in the past.,1
TTN-TPA round-trip. Booked 1 week in advance and paid under $200 round-trip whereas US Airways and Southwest's fares were twice as much. Overall good value for money. In addition to the savings on airfare I was able to park for free at the Trenton airport. Since the flights were full we were given the opportunity to gate check our carry-ons and pick them up at baggage claim. This came in handy flying from TTN to TPA since I wouldn't have to carry my garment bag through the Tampa airport. But I would advise don't gate check carry-ons when flying into a small airport like Trenton. I had to wait in a cramped baggage claim for probably 30 minutes for my bag no thanks to the ground crew taking their sweet time. As much as I don't like the Philadelphia airport at least bags are going around the carousel by the time I get to baggage claim. Also although Frontier has DirecTV on the seat backs if you get the lowest fare you have to pay extra for it. And if you're thinking about purchasing snacks you better have a credit or debit card because they don't accept cash.,1
Cardiff - Singapore: May 10th/11th - Business Class. For various reasons I was unable to book this flight until the day of travel so it was an expensive flight but my phone reservation was handled promptly and efficiently. Check in at Cardiff was smooth and the lounge offered a selection of Welsh drinks. There was priority boarding onto the old F-70 which was not full and only 2 in business class. The aircraft looked like it had recently been refurbished. A smooth but short transfer at Schipol into 1J on B777-300ER where pre-take off drinks were offered. The whole flight was good although my AV didn't work for the first two hours. It was my birthday the next morning so I was woken with a champagne breakfast. Great crew.,1
Flew Malaga to Exeter today with faulty air con causing overheating in the cabin. Cabin staff were ignoring call buttons as the temperature soared until finally speaking with the pilot. We fly to and from Malaga every three weeks and the crew are never welcoming and the planes used are tired with faulty tables etc.,0
Auckland via Seoul from Heathrow. The breakfast selection was very poor in that the only breakfast available was Korean. I think this is very poor as they should have catered to accommodate passenger requirements. The landing time to connection flight was only an hour and in that time you have to get through their internal security checks which takes up a lot of that time. So if you are thinking of getting your duty free you will not have allot of time as the connecting flight was delayed a little to accommodate the late passengers that was held up by internal security checks. Apart from that the rest of the flight was very good.,1
We were delayed 2 hrs on our flight from Denver to Los Angeles. Now on our return flight we are delayed 1 hr to begin with. The plane has landed but now it is delayed for 1-2 hrs because there is no crew for the plane. This is ridiculous. 2 of their flights were cancelled today and 3 have been delayed. ,0
Pangkal Pinang (Bangka) to Jakarta what should be a one-hour flight. Flight delayed by 4.5 hours and almost no information given. I eventually found out that the plane was still in Jakarta awaiting the pilot. After a one-hour delay we were given chicken and rice (horrid if you're a vegetarian but that's Indonesia for you!). After that nothing - not even a word about compensation. The staff were fine onboard - it's the management who need a serious shake- up if they think a 4.5 hour delay for a 1-hour flight is in any way acceptable.,1
"Flight to Larnaca was a joy. Generous legroom, nice meals and a fantastic range of drinks to choose from. Crew was attentive and it is nice that Aegean leave the cockpit door open during boarding..",1
Flew Hawaiian from Sydney this August. Could not sit in lounge at airport until just before boarding. Arrived at Honolulu to Big Island. Boarded plane but could not take off. They had no air con. Finally took off but could not disembark. Door could not open. It was an extremely long trip. Coming home we were told just before boarding from Honolulu there would be no audio for. 10 hour flight. I had to upgrade as I cannot sit in a confined space for that amount of time. Seated in business class. The air con was freezing all the way. Given IPads but battery kept running out. Could not rewind to where I finished my movie so had to watch it all over again with another IPad. The air con was freezing all the way home. Even the crew were wearing jackets jumpers etc. it was the worst trip there and back we have ever encounterd. Never again. Could not even get a cup of coffee after dinner. Only tea. Did not have decaf coffee. Someone forgot to make it.,0
BKK-DXB-DME Business class return. Excellent flight super service as usual too bad the flight between Bangkok and Dubai only last 5 hours. As a gold member the chief cabin comes and welcome you personally on board. Food is very good with great choices.,1
Business class between Nairobi and Heathrow good both ways. Charming staff comfortable seats and a great effort to provide food for a gluten free vegetarian! Flights on time. Entertainment limited but overall pleasantly surprised.,1
"IAD-CDG, 2nd June. CDG-CAI, 4th June. Check in at Dulles Airport was excellent and fast through sky priority, the Business class Lounge at Dulles was overcrowded  but I had my space any way. Boarding was on time , but we stayed at the Airplane almost an hour not moving as the pilot says it was because of the traffic, so we end up with a delay of 75 min. Lots of people lost their connection in CDG. The flight was excellent, service was great with excellent food and beverage. The Videos were the same as KLM in MAY, as I flew to IAD by KL. The second flight from CDG to CAI has almost the same delay, with the same traffic reason. Service, and food were excellent,
comfortable seats and good music. ",1
"Have flown with Rex 3 times Sydney - Albury and have a few more sectors booked. Small Saab aircraft - but that means quick boarding and disembarking! Relatively comfortable and flight crew very fast and efficient. Always with a smile. Although you wouldn't want to be taller than 6'3"" (I'm 6'3"") to sit in their seats - unless you can secure the emergency exit row! A pleasure to fly with.",0
As a disabled passenger they could not have been more helpful and the flight from Heathrow to Cairo was excellent. Food and cabin staff good the only downside was the rather definite landing we had. Flight by Airbus from Cairo to Alexandria again had lovely cabin staff and refreshments served twice during 40 min flight. Airport staff at Cairo and Alex also friendly and helpful which makes a change.,1
Toronto to Halifax. Service was great flight attendants friendly and cheerful. Little touches like free water tea coffee or juice were great. Free beverages and meals are good and finally the price was also great.,1
LTN-EWR Return. We just flew this airline for the first time and can strongly recommend it. We caught a train (frequent service) to Luton Parkway from central London and were transferred to the Silverjet terminal by complimentary taxi. All relatively straightforward. Check in was the best I have ever experienced- staff take your passport and whilst you sit in the lounge enjoying breakfast they complete the check in procedure. Very stress free. Our outgoing flight was an hour late in departing due to adverse weather conditions but passengers were kept updated and the pilot himself came into the lounge to introduce himself and explain what was happening. This was representative of the whole experience - staff friendly (they ask onboard how you wish to be addressed) and courteous but informal which is a very pleasant departure from other airlines I have been on. Food was better on the outbound leg and the departure lounge in New York is a little small but overall this was one of the best airline experiences I have ever had and despite the inconvenience of leaving from Luton will certainly be using them again. Re previous comments about passenger numbers - our flights were both running at about 80% full - I only hope that this continues to improve as this airline deserves to succeed.,1
I flew with this airline from Brussels to London. The check-in process was fine as was the bag drop too. Queue management was not very good at all and caused a few concerns to say the least. I found the cabin to be clean and tidy and in good order. The crew were pleasant and efficient if rather lacking in ability to deal with 3 rowdy passengers. I had the cheapest seating option and for a short flight it was tolerable!,1
We had an early morning flight (6.15) and were delayed due to an inflight computer problem. There were no coffee or tea served on the flight because the equipment was not working. The ground staff do not enforce their carry-on baggage rules which mean some people are going on with numerous pieces of luggage or luggage way larger that the specified sizes. If you follow the boarding procedures and are the last group to be called your chances of being able to put your carry-on in the overhead bins are very slight because of amount of carry-on luggage other people have put there. The seats are very tight with minimal legroom so when you have to stow you carry-on under the seat in front of you it just adds to the discomfort. The return flight was equally as bad for most of the same problems.,0
"CPH-SFO in SAS Plus. SAS Plus is not quite business but far better than Premium Economy on most airlines. For example I've flown Y+ on KLM which basically means a little more legroom but otherwise the same as Y. With SAS Plus however you get FastTrack security check Lounge Access (at least their CPH lounge is pretty good with showers decent food and alcohol selection and fairly quiet at least when I flew quick internet access). The flight itself is in a bit wider seats than Y (wide enough to not be a problem I sat next to a ""heavier"" gentleman and we had no issues with the shared armrest) and with more than enough legroom. The food and drink service is also much better than in normal Y class. Unlimited alcoholic drinks and snacks throughout the flight and fairly good inflight meals (both dinner and breakfast - I really enjoyed the breakfast) with steal cutlery ceramics and glass instead of plastic plastic and plastic. Together with the 200% FF miles earning this was all a good value compared to regular economy. Especially if you upgrade through OptionTown. The only negatives is the tiny and dimly lit IFE system - I would have been better off watching a movie on my phone or tablet. However movie selection was good and recent (with at least a handful of the current year's blockbusters already available). And as always with SAS the cabin crew was excellent.",1
Just flown back from Gibraltar with them. The flight was delayed passenger boarding eventually started then stopped. Chaos ensued with very angry ground staff doing their best. Once onboard the loading stopped again as the disabled passengers suddenly arrived for boarding clearly no liaison with ground. What followed was like a scene from a comedy film terrible. Eventually and after much delay we got underway. Complete bunch of amateurs. If this is what they call fighting for their jobs well best of luck they will need it. Plenty of alternatives out there.,0
Dubai-Muscat-Bangkok. Apart from the 0600 departure from Dubai and a 3 hour wait in Muscat everything else was splendid. My business class fare was cheaper than certain airline's economy class. B737-800 from Dubai to Muscat and A330-200 Muscat to Bangkok. Business Class on A330 is configured with 1-2-1 seating layout. Nice cabin colours nice lighting and authentic Omani decorations throughout the cabin. The seats convert into full-flat beds and segregated into individual pods. Privacy is optimum. Exceptional food and presentation good quality and quantity. Cabin crew very responsive. Perhaps just some slightly wider choice in the AVOD would make it perfect.,1
Whilst the service was reasonably good I have never sat in such uncomfortable seats. The 11 hour 20 minute flight from Osaka to Amsterdam on a Boeing 777 was the most uncomfortable I've ever been. The problem wasn't the leg room which was similar to most economy cabins it was the width of the seat and the actual comfort of the seat - it's the first flight where I've experienced backache. When I transferred in Amsterdam to a KLM Fokker 70 to fly back to Leeds it was bliss the economy seats were like padded armchairs. I've made a mental note never to fly in a 777 again unless there's absolutely no choice and the journey is of extreme importance.,0
March 2014: My flight from Washington DC to California had a lay over in Phoenix AZ. My 9.30 pm connecting flight got delayed then cancelled due to rain. However they didn't tell us this information until a long time after it already showed up online as flight being cancelled. The rude customer service staff at the airport were rescheduling probably 150+ flights told us that there were no hotels available or lounges. They did not give us any water food (restaurants were all closed) or blankets. We sat in the cold airport all night (over 11 hours). We were not allowed to get to our luggage unless we had medication we had to take. I fly a lot but this is my first and last time flying US Airways. I have never experienced such disorganization inept and rude customer service representatives and overall horrible service.,0
MEL-PVG-LHR-PEK-PVG-MELin J Class. PVG-LHR was code-share using Virgin so won't comment on that. CA178 was my first long-haul with CA. Mostly it was a pleasant trip with good service. A330 was in good condition. A few scuff marks at feet level. Bathrooms were clean throughout. Captain spoke excellent English and FA announcements were clear English. Requests to FAs were mostly understood. Service when the call button was pressed was very prompt. Meals were fine. Presentation was a bit naff but food OK. The seat was good the design made me think of J in Lufthansa. I worked the whole trip so didn't try it as a bed. Access to the power point and headphone socket was fiddly under an armrest. The overhead light was not accurately aimed at the table. Amenity pack was OK. Mostly working so not much time for AVOD. Video feed quality was excellent. Headphones not noise cancelling but adequate. LHR-PEK - Departed on time. Good quality pyjamas provided and the bed comfortable. Blanket a bit on the small size. Meal service was fine. Choice of movies was OK. Headphones were very good with noise cancellation. PEK-MEL - First time trying PEK as a transit. Not good. Arrived in T3. After walking about a kilometre reached the transit desk. Half an hour later I was through. Had to take the train then finally get to the domestic lounge. Was called to the gate but stood for 45 minutes waiting for the bus to the plane. Plane to Melbourne was via Pudong. Lunch was OK then arrived at PVG. A man with a flag rounded up all the MEL pax and herded us to the baggage claim area then to immigration. Bit of a queue there. So after about a 750m walk arrived back at the same gate same plane. All in all I came away with perception of 4 star service for the air portion. 2 stars for the transit service at PEK maybe 2.5 stars for transit at PVG. A pity because Air China itself was fine.,1
YEG-BCN. Return flight late - 8 hours. Service poor - lack of professionalism no attention to detail. International flight and I had to pay for wine with a poor dinner. Poor selection of entertainment and tiny seats.,0
B777 with lie flat bed LHR-ICN B777 with no AVOD on ICN-SYD route. Really little comparison- service better on newer plane better bedding pillows choice of movies and audio. Soft product fine on both but a grade higher on newer cabin. Food was good but the second meal on the first leg is always a lunch and for ex-UK this is served at 6-7 am. A breakfast option would go down better. Asiana does not allow CPAP machines to be operated from the a/c power supply; this is a great shame as there is no technical reason for the ruling.,1
Flight: In last month. BNE-MEL MEL-BNE. Great trips both times plane arrived early offered emergency exit row both times staff professional and very friendly. Fare was unbeatable. Will definitely fly again.,1
SYD-SGN-CDG and LGW-SGN-SYD. Legs to/from Sydney A330. SGN-Europe on 777-200. All flights landed on time. I found the seats comfortable and was able to sleep on most legs. Food was plentiful although not 5-star. Crew attentive. As previously mentioned lounge at SGN very basic. On the return leg the day stay in the Ho Chi Minh hotel is a big bonus. The only real negative which must be addressed by the airline is the very old business class seating on the 777. On my flight from LGW/FRA 3 seats did not recline and as the cabin was full resulted in three (understandably) very disgruntled passengers. It is simply not good enough to pay the large business class premium for a broken seat for 12 hours (and not fair on the crew either who bore the brunt of it).,1
"This was my first time with British Airways. I was disappointed in the amount of seat/leg room compared to some other airlines I've traveled with. I was also surprised that on longer European flights London to Istanbul for example which I traveled) there was no TV when the flight is as long or longer than flights in Asia from country-to-country which have TV/entertainment system. The universal entertainment system was broken too and the sound wasn't working. The service button to call an attendant was broken too. A stewardess on this particular flight from JFK to LHR (BA1511 on June 19, 2015) was so rude to my daughter. My daughter is unable to eat dairy and both food options on the plane included dairy. My daughter asked nicely if there was any non-dairy options and the stewardess, takes the food from my daughter?s tray and says ?I guess you?re just going to have to eat that salad.??It wasn?t what she said that bothered me, it was the way she said it. She didn?t offer pretzels or non-dairy snacks or anything. This was my first experience with British Airways, and I was disappointed. It wasn?t until my flight back home that I felt a bit better. On my ride back with British Airways, not this flight in specific (from LHR to LAS), I encountered a steward who was very pleasant, polite and very professional. ",0
Flew Dusseldorf to Zurich return. Onward flight was full but crew did their best. Pilot kept us informed during flight even when we were put on hold before landing in ZRH. Got a nice croissant as well as juice and a cup of coffee. Return flight was full again but at the boarding gate agent forced us to give one of our handbag up to be checked in. Agent was rude and was not polite at all. Once on board I asked the purser to get our bag as there was plenty of room in the bins. She approved to take our bag into the cabin. It fitted easily into the bin. Other passengers who had the same rude agent and did not complain their bags were checked into the belly. Flight crew did their best. Flight staff excellent gate staff very poor!,1
Flight 25 April 19 2014 and Flight 26 on April 27 2014. My wife and I have flown Singapore Airlines before and have always been more than satisfied with every aspect of the flight. This trip was even better than in the past. The crew on both flights were exceptionally helpful since my wife had hip surgery recently and needed extra attention. We were accommodated at every turn during the flight. The American carriers could learn a lot from Singapore Airlines.,1
Kerry-Dublin-Kerry on 14th October. Flight is Aer Lingus Regional operated by Stobart Air. Flights departed and arrived on time and were relatively smooth. Transit through Kerry and Dublin airports (with no luggage) was easy. The aircraft was uncomfortably hot during the early morning flight from Kerry. Food was dreadful - a rock hard scone from 'Clodagh's Kitchen'. Not Clodagh's best bake! These are relatively minor though easily resolved quibbles in what is a very useful service.,1
DXB - IAD [Washington DC] in January 2015 economy class. Given the only choice on this direct route is either Emirates or United it's not really much in the way of competition - give me Emirates every time. Emirates has an excellent on-demand in-flight entertainment system decent food efficient multi-lingual staff amenity packs in economy on long-haul flights and all drinks except champagne are complementary in economy. No one really wants to be stuck on a plane for 15 hours but it's on these really long routes that the little extras on Emirates - especially the in-flight entertainment system and power outlets for every seat - come into their own.,1
BCN to STN return. I used to dread flying on Ryanair though in practice I had very little choice. The last year has seen a major improvement as a result of their charm offensive. Gone are the rugby scrums to get the best seats the petty case weighing and the inflexible enforcement of rules. Most of the recent flights I've been on (these two included) have been pretty full but there's been the opportunity to move to a less crowded section in spite of the usual 'not allowed due to weight and balance of the aircraft' nonsense trotted out by the purser at the start of the flight. I was surprised on the outbound sector that they used the jet way piers at BCN thereby loading from only the front door and rendering the boarding process rather chaotic and long-winded. First time I've ever seen this on a FR flight and you can see why they prefer a front and rear door approach. As always both flights were on time and it may just be that I've become immune to them but the intrusive sales related tannoy babble during the flight does seem to have been cut back. As others have said if you stay within their rules flying Ryanair can be reasonably pleasant these days. May it long continue.,1
"This was the first time since 2013 I'd used Oman Air and I would echo what some other reviews have said in that their onboard quality has begun to deteriorate and is showing signs of budget cuts. As always though the ground staff are excellent in London and Bangkok, check in staff are always friendly, welcoming and good to have a small conversation with. I used their online check in which is vastly improved since 2013 but at check in whilst chatting to staff I was moved to exit row seats due to my height which was very nice of them. On board the seat layout is still welcome as the extra space compared to competitors is felt after a few hours in the air. Even the exit row seats feel spacious in width with the wider fixed armrests. The little extras like menus, hot towels, and amenity kits no longer exist. Not major losses but noticeable. Meal portion sizes seem reduced too but the food quality and taste still seems better than competitors. On board staff are polite and professional, not quite as cheery or conversational as some other airlines but certainly everything you need on board. Muscat airport is starting to feel the weight of increased passenger numbers, I still like this old quiet airport but it felt very full this time and the transfer via bus to and from the terminal building is tiresome. There were problems with processing all the boarding passes for my flight and everyone was issued a new one with a new seat which made for an hour long queue to enter the boarding gate and a bit of a hectic mess on board with people wanting to move. For the price during summer and winter I think Oman Air is very hard to beat on this route. I look forward to using them again next year once the new muscat airport opens.",1
LCY-ORY-LCY. Very quick and easy on the way out from London attentive crew and plenty of croissants! Slight delay on return but time was made up and crew managed to come round twice with drinks on such a short flight. Being 6'5 leg room is always my biggest concern especially in a Fokker with no exit row seats but there was ample room for me even by the window. Will definitely choose CityJet again.,1
"We flew ""Business/1st class"" from London to Dublin and then Berlin to London recently on an Airbus A-130 (like a 737). Three seats on a side. The only thing different from coach was they put a tray table over the center seat. The seats were as cramped as Southwest airlines. The service was excellent but the seats made it a bad deal.",0
Lome-Abidjan Business Class. I flew this short 60 min flight from Lome (Togo) to Abidjan (Ivory Coast). The transit time at this small airport was approximately 1 hour. Boarding went smoothly. The bus dropped us of at the stairs (approximately 100m from the gate). My seat was 1D on a Boeing 737 New Generation. All business class seats were configured 2x2 and were all leather. Announcements were made and manual safety instructions shown. Take off was smooth. At cruising level the cabin service started and a warm meal was offered. Soon after tables where cleared and cabin prepared for landing. All in all a very pleasant experience.,1
Frankfurt-Beijing-Changchun and return. Travelled many times between Europe and internally in China. CA is generally prone to cancellations and/or delays. CZ much better in my experience. Latest episode CA flight to Beijing from Changchun cancelled - no explanation. Rescheduled to HU flight with same dep time so that's ok. But HU flight arrived 40 mins late at Beijing T1 not T3 all shuttle buses rammed with people had to get taxi to T3 to avoid missing connection. Generally found service on the planes ok.,0
I flew on flight ET 811 from Addis Ababa to Entebbe on January 30. It was very frustrating. We were to fly at 10.55am but after several delays we lifted off at 8.45pm. The most frustrating aspect was there was no one in authority who could tell us what was happening or when we would actually fly. It appeared that airline employees were avoiding us as they knew we were getting frustrated and they had no good information. Occasionally one of the passengers would find an airline employee who would give them information which was always contradictory and always wrong. If there is an alternative I will not fly Ethiopian Airlines again!,0
In April I took flight from New York (JFK) to Port of Spain with a layover in Panama. Employees are more concerned with conversing with each other than they are helping passengers. They mostly stay hidden during the flight and they don't make many announcements. The food wasn't that great either. Tocumen International Airport is dirty. The furniture has stains and rips. I will not fly Copa again.,0
I flew from Bogota to Manizales just a few days ago. The aircraft appeared brand new and was very clean and comfortable. The staff were most professional and the service (not much as it was such a short flight) was more than adequate. The only problem was the Manizales airport which is often covered by thick cloud and therefore closed because the pilot has to land by sight. Instruments are definitely needed! I wasn't paying for the flight so cannot comment on value.,1
A321 and A320 Kos - Athens / Athens - Vienna May 3 2014. Nice service friendly staff clean and comfortable seats. Simple and useful online check-in.,1
This was a 6 hour trip from San Francisco CA to Newark NJ with no entertainment because the inflight entertainment system did not work at my seat. I asked 2 different flight attendants to restart the unit but they each gave up in one second leaving me with nothing to do or watch for this long trip. The girl sitting in front of me reclined her seat so violently that she knocked the lunch that I had paid for in the airport off the tray and into my lap and the floor. When I demanded that she sit up so I could at least pick it up and dispose of it she complained to the flight attendant that I was keeping her from reclining her seat. I could not order something else to eat because you need the in flight entertainment system to see what is available and order it. Apparently now that there is the in-flight entertainment unit there is no back up in case it doesn't work for some reason.,0
Airbus 380 LHR-DXB and return. Normally fly Qatar but Emirates were more convenient times so I gave them a go. Overall good but not as good as Qatar. Not impressed with the 380 Business cabin they've tried to squeeze in too many seats. OK I'm big but I've never had to ask for a seat extender before in business. Couldn't get the tray fully extended difficult to sleep as too cramped. Cabin staff excellent but due to size of cabin (over 20 rows) we got our wine after we had finished our food. Food fine. So much better than BA but some way to go to match Qatar. Airbus 340 DXB-COK and return. Older than 380 but more room so more comfortable.,1
LHR-PRG-LHR. Met requirements I would expect of a 3-Star airline. Comfortable A319 with leather seats and good legroom. Meal provided satisfactory and efficient cabin crew. Minor delay experienced on return - would use this airline again.,1
SHA-HKG. Flight was an hour late leaving however this is usual from Shanghai. Seats comfortable and service was excellent. Well mannered and well trained crew. Food good and beverages were perfectly adequate.,1
LHR-PEK return in economy. Did the same journey last year this time it was slightly less enjoyable due to the seats I was in on the A330. On both legs 46J and 46L had a dodgy IFE whereas it appeared the rest of the plane was having no problems. Both legs had old interior/IFE seat material was uncomfortable legroom was ok for a small person like myself taller people may have problems. Food wasn't top notch but they still give you 2 full meals. Flight attendants do plenty of drink runs and were friendly. Outbound flight landed 30 mins early inbound landed on time. Will probably fly again as prices and schedules suit me.,1
The bad press surrounding Ryanair proved to be totally unjustified on my round trip Madrid-Cagliari-Madrid. Check- in and security was the quickest and most polite ever (especially at the dedicated check-in/security at Madrid. Boarding was orderly and uneventful (both in Madrid and Cagliari). We left on schedule and arrived early on both segments. The flight attendants were professional polite and friendly. No negative comments at all and I'll be only too happy to fly with Ryanair again.,1
"First time with BA (a code share flight for JAL). Travelled NRT-LHR and return (BA5/BA6) on B777 in CW. Seats are designed in an S shape. This means that half the passengers fly backwards! Seats lie flat but a foot rest has to released from the wall to put your feet/legs on. Width of seats is poor and I found the seating cramped. Service was excellent both ways food good with plenty of drinks and snacks on offer. Very hard to get to storage bin to put your stuff into. One small gripe a 12 hour flight needs more than one meal and a light ""breakfast"". Lounge in Narita good standard but in Heathrow very basic.",1
Bangkok to Melbourne via Brunei. All flights took off a few minutes early and also landed a few minutes early. Given an IPAD for entertainment between Bangkok and Brunei and flight was in an older Airbus 319. Seat was comfortable and service was very good - attentive cabin staff. Had a few hours layover in Brunei and then to Melbourne on older B777. Flight was punctual and the food good. Drinks freely available and plane very lightly loaded - only five in Business Class. Was a bit disappointed that the new 787 was not in operation as seat not so comfortable as a bed. Film selection was a bit limited. Royal Brunei is a comfortable three star airline without pretensions but Royal Brunei offers excellent value for money in Business Class which is why I continue to fly with them on a regular basis.,1
First time we have flown easyjet went to Cyprus on 12th May 2013 returning on 19th. Both flights were fantastic no delays plane very clean and comfortable but the thing that made it pleasurable were the very friendly staff very professional without being stuffy.,1
Luxor to Cairo (return) didn't expect a drink or anything for this one hour flight so quite surprising to receive one! Cabin Crew on both flights were pleasant and although the safety routine was quite bizarre and sort of rushed all safety cards were up to date and in place. The return flight was the Express version of Egyptair and to be honest I couldn't tell the difference as service and friendliness was just as good. Both modern and clean aircraft utilised.,1
ADD-AMM via Sanaa. Overnight in Sanaa where Yemenia provide hotel and breakfast. Pleasant flight attendants and acceptable food. A good flight and a lot cheaper than competitors. I had to change this flight and put it forward by one week which was no problem and didn't cost anything to change.,1
Flew BNE-DXR-LHR and return on A380 all legs. I had great crew on every single leg who were friendly and attended to our wants at all times. In between meal services we were constantly supplied with water/juice. All legs bar one departed on or close to time (dep LHR one hour late but arrived pretty much on time to DXB). My only complaint would be the lack of leg room in economy class and the bottom part of the seat was a bit too soft. Seat width was fine and meals were just above the average for economy class Would recommend Emirates economy for a competitive price and decent service as long as you remember if you want top shelf seats and service to fly business or first! Wifi service is non existent/very hard to connect to in DXB which isn't an emirates thing but does reflect on them as it's their home airport.,1
MAD-PHL and return. Overall good. Both planes on time. First leg plenty of empty spaces so you can stretch. Main meal average but last minute pastrami sandwich quite tasty. Good selection of movies and music system a bit low at times. Nice crew. No lost baggage. Second leg full plane dinner ok breakfast a bit poor: muffin and coffee or juice. I didn't have to pay for the headphones. Toilets well maintained all flight long. I would fly with them again.,1
Overall a pleasant experience despite the fact we didn't get the seats we booked on any leg of our journey this caused some stress as we are a group of 6 people travelling with children. The seats on the LHR-DEL flight were comfortable and IFE was excellent. The food was ok would have been nice if they catered for the kids. Staff were pleasant and helpful. We had a 2 hour delay due to fog before we could depart for Bangkok. Our return journey was without any delays we stopped in Mumbai on return and security was effortless - was expecting chaos from reading other reviews.,1
Boston - CDG in Business (bonus ticket): Sat in 3L a spacious bulkhead seat on Boeing 777. Crew very nice and helpful seat was pretty comfortable although not completely flat. Didn't check the entertainment as it was a night flight and wanted to relax and get some sleep what I did. Dinner was fine although not exceptional. Wine selection was good. Breakfast was a bit slim croissant and pain au chocolat were rather old and dry however the fruit platter was nice. No warm egg plate was offered. Overall a sound service and good experience.,1
I flew on 20 December 2014 on Bulgaria Air from Vienna to Sofia. Given other reviews about this airline I was concerned about flying BG Air at first and was in the end decently surprised about the flight - My flight was operated by an Airbus A319. The flight attendants were extremely kind and helpful yet spoke below average English. The food on board consisted of an extremely tasty sandwich accompanied by a chocolate as Dessert which was also tasty. Two rounds of drinks were served on this flight. The flight was full and uneventful. The aircraft required better cleaning. Overall I'd fly Bulgaria Air again but they really need to improve their services on board as well as other minor products despite their cheap airfares.,1
I recently flew Oslo to Amsterdam and I was quite pleased. Customer service at Oslo was excellent. I flew on an oldish 737-400 and had economy seats. Seats were surprisingly spacious and comfortable. The inflight service was decent but the thing that bothered me was that the food wasn't free and the prices were quite expensive. Flight was pretty good no delays and I got to Amsterdam safely.,1
Rhodes to Birmingham Saturday 5th July. Over eleven hours late with no explanation other than 'technical problems'. It should have left after nine hours but no staff were on duty to keep us informed and a 7.30 am flight finally took off at 7.16pm. The staff were miserable and surly. No route map on the inflight and the front toilet locked on both journeys.,0
VA23 MEL-LAX Premium (11 H) connecting from OOL. Luggage checked entire way through had to pick up express boarding pass in MEL (not sure if comes with premium or not I'm a Platinum FF). Cabin was practically full with only a couple of seats spare. Plenty of legroom although the 2 heights that the footrest sits at doesn't make it overly comfortable the seat width difference is definitely noticeable vs domestic economy. Amenities bag comes with socks eye mask toothbrush/paste hand cream tissues and a pen (which is more than I can say for SQ business). Headphones provided are noise blocking - and they definitely work. Every meal had tomato and cheese in it which was not only a little disappointing but seriously lacking in originality the chicken was nice and tender though once I scraped the tomato off! Breakfast (scrambled eggs) was so/so the bacon the only redeeming factor in a pretty lacklustre meal. Inflight entertainment (RED) didn't have a massive choice. The best bit would have to be the service. From the FA's to the pilots keeping us up to date on delays could not have asked for better - the staff are definitely what make flying Virgin Australia a happy experience! I used points to upgrade not sure if I'd pay for Premium outright but using points or paying for an upgrade last minute on a return leg is worth it.,1
BKK-HEL and return business. Flights were punctual and cabin staff pleasant and efficient. The new business class seats and cabin are excellent and the food and drink of high quality - even a dessert wine. The IFE choice is though still not as good as some other carries economy provision. BKK-HEL now departs at 9 am which means you have lunch at 10.30 am (no dining on demand) and are then required to spend the rest of the day sitting in the dark - something I greatly dislike. Vantaa airport which used to be a delight is now grossly overcrowded. They still work miracles with luggage transfer but passenger circulation is very problematic. Transit passengers now have to go through long security queues. I found it difficult to find the business class check-in got in the wrong queue. There were no staff providing queue management and advice.,1
BKK-SIN return. Check-in at BKK easy with no queue A320 75% full. Very tight seat pitch. Seat has no recline. Long 30 mins check-in queue at Changi Terminal 1 at 5.30 am. Plane new and clean. You have to pay for everything so you get what you pay for.,0
Flew Chengdu to Guangzhou on 16 Nov 2013 - no problem with flight and service but would not check my bag through to a connecting international flight with a China Southern flight number as it was a code share operated by Vietnam Airlines very inconvenient to have to pick up baggage and make way to international with bags when ultimately flying with same company. My connection time was OK (2hrs) but eaten into severely by bag taking a long time to reach reclaim - almost lost and then rushed to international where I was in time to check in but told to 'hurry up' by the check in staff - ridiculous as they were the ones that had caused the problem with the late bag and not checking through. Made the whole thing a hassle and made out to be my fault!,0
I took the afternoon flight from Helsinki to Warsaw on the 10th of September. The check in agent was kind and did her job well. The same kindness was shown from the lady who handled the departure gate alone. She was generous and offered me another seat where I was able to have the whole row alone. The onboard service was good and crew smiled a lot. There were a lot of verbal interaction between cabin crew and passengers. The announcements from technical crew were loud and clear. This was my second flight with Finnair and they did not disappoint me.,1
Friday 26 Sep 2014 my wife and I went to BTV for what we thought were two legs of a flight on United Airlines that would get us into SFO at 12.40 PT. We actually arrived at approximately 02.30 PT on Saturday about 14 hours late. Part of the delay was caused by someone starting a fire in the FAA control tower at ORD. I have no complaints with United about that. My complaint with United is its total lack of communication on that Friday and on the return the following Friday. On the first leg from BTV to ORD United kept telling us we had to wait an hour. We could not leave we had to sit there with no information hour by hour from 07.00 to 16.00. The only thing we were told was our connections would be okay because they could not fly either. United even put us on the plane and pulled away from the gate at about 12.30. Then they brought us back to the gate and had us deplane and wait some more. Finally we left at about 16.00 and got to ORD expecting to get on the flight to SFO we were told was waiting. Imagine our surprise and anger to find the flight had left hours before. We were told we would have to stay the night in Chicago at our expense and leave in the morning! When I asked what about getting on the SFO flight the customer service person said it was fully booked and had a wait list. When I pushed the agent did put us on the wait list. One piece of luck we got on the plane. It was late enough that other people did not show. We spent the week in SFO and went to the airport in plenty of time. We had checked in for the return flight when we checked in for the outbound flight online. We went to the kiosk to check-in and there was no reservation. The agent at SFO was able to get us on the plane somehow so we relaxed again almost as much as we were when we went to the airport. Then she hit us with an unwarranted baggage charge. It was unwarranted because we used a United MileagePlus card for the flight. Despite realizing we had not been charged for the bags on the way out to SFO she would not believe us they should not be charged for. When we got to ORD we discovered our flight to BTV was not our originally scheduled 3 hour layover but an 8 hour layover. Again there was no communication from the SFO agent to us about changing our second leg it was just done. After a lot of talking we got onto our originally scheduled flight and got home on schedule.,0
SIN-HAK-SIN. Cheapest option available and pretty decent for a budget airline. Standard A320 with cloth seats which suit me just fine. Legroom adequate which I found surprising as I had issues with legroom using rival airlines'. Did not purchase food on board which is understandably expensive. SIN-HAK was smooth and punctual just that children on board the flight were very noisy. HAK-SIN was delayed and experienced slight turbulence and bad weather delayed landing even more. Overall rather value-for-money.,1
I travelled on September 19 from Barcelona Spain to Oslo Norway on SK4686 (13.20-16.40). I had made reservations in SAS Plus (former Business Class) and was seated on 2F. The aircraft used on this service was a Boeing 737-800W. The general impression though travelling in SAS Plus is that of a low-cost airline. The generally very good impression of SAS cabin staff was missing on this flight no spirit and nothing extra. It seemed to just be another ordinary day on duty without any enthusiasm and lack of special attention to the passengers. There are no longer any free middle-seat in SAS Business Class (now named SAS Plus). This particular flight was fully booked in SAS Plus so the comfort was not good. When boarding the aircraft in Barcelona it was extremely hot in the cabin no air-condition were available until slightly before pushback from the gate. This particular aircraft did not have a SAS interior (different seats colour panels etc). The seat pitch was very limited but the seats were however much more comfortable than SAS ordinary seats. The in-flight service started about 25 minutes after departure with the choice of a cold sandwich salad or a hot vegetarian pizza-slice all meals served in a paper box. I choose the salad which on this flight was a chicken salad. To my opinion the salad was not tasteful and tasted like all the other salads that SAS offers on intra-European flights - definitely a much lower quality than to be expected by a Star Alliance member. After an additional 15-20 minutes drinks were served i.e. no good timing or thought-through service. Pre-dinner drinks after the meal strange? After an additional 3-5 minutes coffee and tea was served without even being able to take two sips of my pre-meal drink. I travel with SAS quite a lot but unfortunately I must admit that the quality of the product offered is not good and can not be compared what the other Star Alliance members offer. I'm on the verge to no longer recommend SAS Scandinavian Airlines.,0
MNL-TPE v.v. Check-in was fast at NAIA however small confusion that the monitor is showing a wrong counter for the flight and were directed by the ground staff to the other side. Flight left on time on both sectors clean cabin but with a broken tray table legroom is restricted and uncomfortable for a red-eye flight since most PAX reclining their seatbacks so it was hard to move. FAs were mixture of smiling and cheerful ladies down to bored but still polite crew and I like that they were proactive in turning on/off the reading lights for the PAX. Buy-on-board choices are good and I think were in the right price too. Overall it was a good value for the money especially for short flights and I would recommend it to those travellers who are on a budget.,1
"Unfriendly check in. No knowledge or desire to seat passengers comfortably. This leads to getting on to a half empty flight and discovering people are packed in to the middle rows when half the other rows are empty. Delays - almost never leave on time. Communication about delays is poor/non-existent. Stewardesses often with very little English skills. Their programming is to simply follow a checklist. Abysmal food. Eat before you get on or take your own food. Many planes arriving in Shanghai supposedly their ""home airport"" get met with buses. Poor thin seats with little padding and minimal recline. Dirty toilets. Entertainment system or lack of. No in-seat entertainment. Small dropdown screens every 5th row with subtitles too small to read. Don't think business is better. MU business is maybe on par with other airlines economy in terms of food and entertainment. Complete lack of understanding of service culture. If service is important to you avoid MU.",0
Glasgow to Prague 12 August. Arrived at the airport in plenty of time and were allocated seats 1A and 1B. Thought great seats until we got on and were surrounded behind and to the side by a load of drunks on a stag holiday. They were up all the time knocking the seats and shouting and singing. Cabin crew did nothing to calm them down except keep serving them more and more alcohol. Aircraft was a very old Boeing 737 Cargo/combo. The seats are on pallets and raised higher than normal meaning the windows are nearly at waist level. Very noisy aircraft. Seats very slim and quite hard with little padding.,0
HKG-HEL-HKG on the A340. Food and service were adequate and the seats comfortable by day. But they are not flat beds and only reach an angle of about 15 degrees making them very uncomfortable for sleeping.,0
Flew from Kuwait - Colombo round-trip. Business class cabin very comfortable and seats recline to 180 degrees making it a comfortable fully-flat bed. Cabin crew very attentive and professional. My dinning experience was very good. Would defenitly recommend this airline and can't wait to fly with them again soon.,1
Izmir to Zurich. Great value for money aircraft confortable breakfast served and tasty crew very attentive. Cannot fault any aspect of this service for the fare paid.,1
Hiroshima-Frankfurt via Incheon and onwards to Amsterdam via Lufthansa. Seat 2E on the Airbus to Incheon and service was very good bar the poor English language skills of the flight attendants. Seat 11J on the 747 Upper Deck was only half full. Service was again very good and the only minus was the limited selection on the AVOD.,1
SYD-VLI-SYD in business class. I agree with others comments on the service and friendliness of the airline but Air Vanuatu must do something to improve their business class seats - although they are wide enough the pitch is dismal and does not even allow a footrest. I would urge Air Vanuatu to at least upgrade to Air Pacific standards ie a 50 inch pitch and seats with a proper footrest. Otherwise I can only commend the airline.,0
Beijing-Xiamen on Dec 18 first time with Xiamen Airlines. Old B737-700 but clean and well-maintained. On-time departure and arrival. During the 3hrs flight delicious hot lunch and several rounds of beverages served they even served peanuts after lunch and mints before landing! Friendly and efficient cabin crew well-done Xiamen Airlines!,1
"My wife and I were on AF72 yesterday from Paris to LAX and we were in Business Class.  We noticed a large downgrade in service from a similar flight we had about 4 years ago. What surprised us the most was the very average service in flight, such as not picking up meal plates, refilling our beverages and the like.  It also
seemed like we were supposed to take our trays back, go pick up our beverage at the cart and fend for ourselves. The meals were not much better.  The salmon I was served was well done and I still don't know what the ""side"" was. My observation is that we were not the only ones who raised their eyebrows to a fairly disappointing Business Class experience. True be told, it reminded us of what traveling in coach was 12 years ago.

"Flight was delayed four times, for a total of 4 hours. Signed up for text alerts for both our flight and the incoming flight we were waiting on. Only received alerts for the first couple of hours. Allegiant even deleted our boarding passes on their app so used ID's at gate to board. Air conditioning did not work for several rows of seats, while my husband's did not turn off and it froze. If a traveller is not on a tight time schedule to arrive at their destination and doesn't mind being inconvenienced by their poorly maintained planes, their flights are very inexpensive. Bottom line - Allegiant passengers get what they pay for.",0
"I am a frequent flyer passenger with TAP. I flew from Lisbon to Geneva yesterday (2 pm flight October 22 2013). Only when we were on board did the announcement come that they were flying with a ""minimum crew"" and therefore there would be no on-board service. During the 2.5 hour flight they offered us a glass of water. I know this airline is in trouble financially but they could have announced the absence of service before people boarded (preferably at check-in) so that we could at least buy some food and coffee to take on board (Starbucks in the departure lounge for example). This has never happened to me before - on this or any airline.",0
"Travelled STN-VLC (Valencia) on 8 September and back on 12 September. Trip going out was very good. I am 6ft 4in tall and had one of the emergency exit rows over the wings and there was plenty of space. Cabin crew very attentive on the way out not so much on the way back but still good. Over 2 hour delay on the way back as the plane had to go to Ibiza for ""operational reasons"" first and then come back and take us to London. So long as you play by their rules and are not an idiot when it comes to reading their instructions they are not a bad airline to use for short trips.",1
Have just arrived in Rio de Janeiro from Miami with a change of planes in Atlanta. From Miami to Atlanta pilot did not even announce the flight duration. From Atlanta to Rio service was certainly not bad by U.S. standards. IFE was good-managed to watch a new release in my personal screen-while alcoholic beverages were also complementary throughout the flight. Arrived on-time in Rio de Janeiro only to find-out that my luggage did not make the tight connection in Atlanta. All in all certainly an acceptable trip and would do it again.,1
"Vancouver to Paris and back. Flight over was great plane with new interior. Food was decent and the staff very friendly. On are way back we had an older plane the individual LCD screen that was not very responsive but once the film started it worked well. My only complaint is that when there was an announcement on the intercom when you were using the entertainment ""with ear buds"" was way too loud.",1
PEK - Shanghai. Check in Beijing was very quick. The crew were very friendly and spoke good English. The safety announcement was only given in Chinese on a drop down screen which you could not really see. Both domestic flights were on a fairly old 767 and full. Complimentary drinks and food served on both flights.,0
I flew from LHR to HKG and HKG to Cebu on 20/12/2014. I have made CX my preferred airlines as they always make a fuss of me. Check in was fast and efficient lounge at London was comfortable and quite. I was very well looked after on both segments of my flights. Food excellent and service very good. January from Cebu to HKG and HKG to LHR I had a dreadful cough and not at all well and was not able to sleep well however the flight attendant really looked after me making sure I had hot drinks.,1
Flight KC929 20 February. Was an overnight flight. Flight left on time and cabin crew were extremely thoughtful. Placed blanket over me while sleeping and when woke even though food service had finished and on way to landing - they found an apple to give me. Was a great experience and very impressed by cabin crew attitude.,1
Bought 3 round-trip tickets. Flights were delayed up to 3.5 hours one way and 2 the other way. Switched the gates on us 6 times. Staff unfriendly and rude. Inflight crew rude and obnoxious to passengers. No apology given and got bounced around to different departments. Each department accepted no responsibility. My time is more valuable then $25 when I had to wait multiple hours deal with miscommunication and nasty staff. Finally they tried to give me a $25 voucher for my complaint. Worst service I have ever experienced.,0
I booked a flight to Bahamas through United and it was their Silver Airlines. My flight over was late and coming back the plane had 20 plus passengers and we were all checked in and they delayed our departure. We all missed our connecting flights. There was no apologies no explanations. We were to depart at 2.25 finally getting off the ground at 6.25. Since I was heading to New England there were no seats and I had to purchase a new ticket on a different airline and could only get to Hartford. That ticket cost me $600 and I am very upset with their lack of customer service. My advice don't fly United Silver unless you have make your flights a day apart. This company didn't apologize and kept us in the dark.,0
My family and I traveled down from Chicago O'Hare (ORD) to Los Cabos (SJD) and back for winter break. The first flight was not good. The seats were uncomfortable and the IFE (even though it was the ceiling types) were not working. All they gave was drinks and food was way over priced. This made a 4 hour flight seem like a 9 hour flight. There were no delays or problems with check-in. On the way back we were delayed a day but that was our choice. The same plane on the way back had a faulty fuel pump and could not be fixed at Cabo. So if they were to fly the aircraft was way overweight. The pilot announced that 20 people had to leave the aircraft or everyone could fly but only 40 baggage could be kept onboard. The flight was full so that would leave at least 200 people stranded in ORD. My family had no intention to fly a 4 hour flight with a faulty fuel pump so we exited the aircraft. Plus who wouldn't want an extra day in a tropical place? American Airlines gave us one night at an all- inclusive resort on the ocean with free transportation to and from the resort. They had also booked us for the flight the next day. That was the good part. The next day the gate was crowded because they were trying to board two flights at one gate. It was a total disaster. We were delayed about 1 hour but managed to get to ORD ahead of schedule.,0
Trip from Frankfurt to Dublin in Business Class on A319 (no connecting flight). You get what you expect. The weak point is the seating of NEK as its an Economy Class Seat with the middle-Seat blocked. Seat pitch and space are not luxury the recline is ridiculous and it feels somewhat cheap. There is no IFE and no power socket what was not so important on this 110 minutes flight. Nevertheless I would spend the money again as the rest was really ok.,1
Biz seat is fine for the price service is good staff very attentive. The only bad point is the poor quality of the IFE but with an IPOD and a good book you don't care! From Paris it was good catering. Biz bed is great for a night flight a duvet pillow and you can ask when you want to dine. Good flight on time.,1
ADD-NBO-ADD. Both flights on time. Easy check in. Wonderful new aircraft the Embraer 190 lifts the whole experience above almost all medium haul flights in my entire life. I volunteered to downgrade on the ADD-NBO leg as the flight was sold out and I was only stand-by despite having a booking. However the ticket was issued for the following morning and I had the choice either to downgrade or to wait. But even the economy class was a very good experience despite being full: lots of food (2 food options + vegetarian) constant refill of drinks and the aircraft completely clean and staff observant and kind and quick. Not denied anything. On the way back same excellent service even the tax-free worked well. Very detailed enjoyable and interesting info from captain on both legs the entire cockpit staff was introduced and likewise the chief purser. Nice seats spacious with power-outlets. A great experience. IFE seemed not working but who cares?,1
TLV-VIE-WAW and back with A321 (TLV-VIE-TLV) Q400 (VIE-WAW) and Fokker 70 (WAW-VIE). A very nice experience though waiting times in Vienna for connecting flights long (there isn't much to do at VIE a/p). Service very attentive staff extremely friendly and meals delicious (VIE-WAW-VIE - snacks only but full bar service).,1
Trip FRA-SIN and BKK-FRA on A380/A340 respectively. Friendly crew good service. IFE has improved too. New seats in economy are OK but seem of poor quality as the recline function was already faulty after not a very long-time in service. I always notice that the crew 'vanish' after their routine service.,1
Good cheap airline. Seats quite close together but ok for short flight. Staff polite and helpful. It offers very cheap fights within Asia and you can pre-book extra weight luggage at very a reasonable price. Have used this airline on numerous different flights and they have always been reliable. This is the first time I have landed at LCCT in KUL - ladies loos very dirty. Chaotic but not too bad luggage didn't take too long to arrive.,1
NBO-MBA. ATR-42 not exactly new but well kept. Courteous inflight staff - genuine smiles. Some refreshment option of coffee or soda and poorly packed 4 biscuits. Overall experience okay and suitable for the no frills traveller especially for short haul. Always compare prices though because they are at times higher than those for the national carrier which operate bigger and much faster shuttles on the same route.,0
"ORD-NRT Business. The cabin is neat and clean and the service far surpasses anything that the US flagged carriers offer for International travel. The business seats have their plusses and minuses. It is very hard for a 6' person and above to get comfortable sleeping on the ""slope"". The padding is very thin so sitting or sleeping is a bit rough. AVOD system is excellent and includes noise cancelling head phones. Once you get used to the ""A la Carte"" style service ANA offers meal and beverage service is fantastic. Food was good and plentiful. The biggest advantage of the service is the attitude. The flight attendants really made you feel welcome unlike anything the US majors have to offer. One heads up would be about the use of the Red Carpet lounge; They do not offer ANA Business customers free internet. This is an outrage based on the fare I paid but so be it. The attitude of the UAL attendant in the lounge was typical; poor and she blamed the situation on ANA and how cheap they are.",1
Flew to Cancun in early December from NYC. To return to NYC we arrived at the airport in Cancun more than 2 hours before flight to find the United service desks in complete chaos. The line to check in stretched the entire length of the airport. No one was sure if they were on the right line as the signage was very confusing. No other airline had such problems. Very stressful and unpleasant. Will not fly United to Cancun again.,0
"San Francisco to Hong Kong Economy Class. The seat leg room is good and there is a foot rest. Inflight entertainment system is also wonderful. The food was high quality for Economy Class, and the service is great, flight attendants are friendly and helpful.",1
Avianca is fast becoming one of my favourite airlines (I fly on average once per week for business often internationally). Recently flew Santiago-Bogota-San Jose return and found Avianca excellent in all respects. All flights and connections on- time excellent professional service only spoilt by an obnoxious fellow passenger which meant I may have been avoided by the flight attendants from time to time on one flight. Food and wine excellent and a very good lounge in Bogota. Avianca uses the COPA lounge in San Jose which is fine with good personal service provided.,1
Flew from Niagara Fall to Clearwater. It was supposed to be a 3 day get away. Waited close to 12 hours on the trip down only to have it cancelled late that night there were no other planes available. The staff at the airport were very accommodating and apologetic however the person who was calling the shots on how to handle the issues missed the ball entirely. We finally got out the next morning. There were quite a few Allegiant planes at the terminal the next morning not sure where they were the day before. Coming home there was another mechanical issue with our plane and we were delayed another 2 hours. We've flown many times and have never experienced any lengthy delays like this one. Our whole trip was book thru Allegiant waiting on rebates hope that comes on time!,0
I recently experienced a great and very comfortable Business Class flight with Lufthansa from Munich to Miami. Perfect service very professional helpful and friendly crew. The food was delicious and a nice variety of wines was served. Everything very clean comfortable seat that was converted into a full flat bed. So I could get some hours of sleep. Very clean plane and technically in perfect shape as far as I a business person could see. Great service so I can highly recommend Lufthansa.,1
85 boy Scouts took flight 63 on 8/2/14. All staff were so pleasant and went around 3 times to make sure we were good with drinks. That was really impressive. They were so kind and even let us know our gates for connecting flights. Nice job! Everything was great.,1
I've flown with Cathay a few times. Recently did SYD-HKG-LHR and return 9 days later (yesterday). I enjoyed my trip and was pleasantly surprised with the food this time more than any other. Seats are a bit comfier with Emirates but for the price being just slightly above the cheapest available I would choose Cathay if on a budget. If I had a bit more money I would prefer Emirates. Staff were very helpful and friendly.,1
SIN-HKT-SIN. Given other reviews we were pleasantly surprised by our first experience on these short flights. Even with baggage and booking fees return trip came to less than GBP90 per person. PDF itinerary was never received by email but it wasn't asked for at check-in. Check-in queue at Changi budget terminal was short and efficient. Flight on time. For return journey no check-in queue at Phuket and we were allocated exit row seats without requesting them. Flight departed on time even though many other flights (including Silk Air to Singapore) were delayed by an hour or two that evening. Plenty of leg room in exit rows but seats don't recline and have no lower-back support. Take a cushion for longer flights! Modern clean cabins on both legs. Would definitely fly Tiger again short-haul.,1
Monarch informed me in advance of time change of outbound flight due to operational reasons. I understand this is happening to all airlines not just Monarch. I was more annoyed as the inbound flight was delayed 2 hours. Check-in agent didn't inform neither me nor other passengers of the delay. When we checked-in at Manchester we were met by an unprofessional lady who seemed not to care about customer service. We were given 2 aisle seats I chose not to pay for online check-in but I asked if there was any chance seating next to my girlfriend the response was: no I'm sorry plane is full. Once we were aboard the plane was half empty. Monarch cabin crew are really good and professional.,0
Qindao-Shanghai Shanghai-Changsha etc. The web-booking is convenient. The check-in is a little slow. Almost severe no delay is in my experience very good for a cheap airline. The aircraft is a little dirty and the seat are very comfortable. There are too much on-board sales so that it's extremely noisy.,0
Return Heathrow Colombo. The planes are very shabby seats dirty and old. The IFE was broken on both legs on my wife's seat when mine worked it kept cutting out and losing the sound the standard of films was terrible 4 very low budget films. Staff really didn't seem interested in their jobs not friendly did the bare minimum. Food just about acceptable better than a 12 hour fast. Booked with them as it was the only direct flight I could find and so thought this would be a better experience than having to take a connecting flight I was wrong.,0
I have travelled many times with Ryanair and never had problems. If you keep to the terms and conditions on the web site you have no problems. Ryanair are the cheapest and best of low cost airlines.,1
We experienced changes in the flight schedules on all three inter-island flights all were announced by SATA several days before the flight so it had nothing to do with bad weather. The flight from Ponta Delgada to Horta would leave at 15.45 in stead of 08.30. The flight from Horta to Terceira would leave at 17.05 instead of 13.25. The flight from Terceira to Ponta Delgada would leave at 13.20 in stead of 14.30. Apart from that the flight from Lissabon to Ponta Delgada was cancelled due to bad weather (so they said). This was handled in a chaotic way. Staff had apparently no idea what to do. After some three hours passengers were told to go to busses that would bring them to a hotel. Unfortunately the bus driver did not receive clear instructions so he dropped us in the wrong hotel. The flight on the next day had a delay of more than 2.5hours for which SATA gave no compensation vouchers.,0
I was booked on a flight from Liverpool to Isle of Man on Wednesday evening 14th.Jan 2015. The flight was cancelled because of gale force winds. Flybe put us all up at an excellent hotel close to the airport and allowed us up to Â£15 each for food and drink that evening. The hotel included breakfast. As there were two flights involved the staff did a great job getting us all rebooked for the next day plus finding accommodation for us.,1
The seat comfort of the new Boeing Dreamliner is very poor there is no comfort foam in the seat cushions it feels right away very hard and after two or three hours it hurts if you have to fly 11 hours? This is a very poor (economy class) passenger seat design of Boeing the thin seat cushions are not finished with durable comfort foam. It will probably be resistant of 16 or 20 G but there is absolutely no passenger comfort in the seat cushion of the Dreamliner.,0
Seats are narrow and hard .If you are taller than 5ft 8 then your knees will be jammed into the row in front of you. Unreal and no entertainment TV nothing on a 5-6 hour flight. Class act have been flying AC for 29 years and never knew rouge was 3rd rate flight at best. Avoid at all costs.,0
Honolulu to Lihue return April 2013. Plane was a basic older style aircraft but comfortable enough for the short 40 min flight. Flight staff are friendly helpful and efficient. However Flight to/from Lihue were extremely delayed with no updates from Island Air staff other than to announce further delays. My observation is that very log delays appear to be the norm for Island Air on all flights. Our extremely delayed flight from Lihue to Honolulu meant we missed our connecting flight despite Island Air representatives assuring us that we would make the connection. We had to find airport accommodation at our own expense at midnight as there were no Island to staff to assist. Wont fly Island Air again unless we absolutely have to and don't have a connecting flight to make.,0
LGW-TFS in November 2014. Flight left Gatwick at about 0900hrs to arrive Tenerife at 1340 hours. We were served a croissant and cereal bar plus coffee and a yoghurt at about 1000hrs. No further trolley service at all during this four and a half hour flight. On the return leg leaving Tenerife at 1415hrs we were served a wrap and a cheese roll with either drink from the bar or hot drink. The drinks were served after the meal. No further trolley service. The seating configuration was tight to say the least and I am 5'8. This felt like a budget airline flight. The Captain asked us to enjoy British Airways hospitality!,0
Just got back home from an around the world trip. 62 hours of total of flying time. Jetstar was not good but I was really disappointed in United Airlines. Our United leg was a 6 hour flight from Newark NJ to LAX. I felt the seats were to close together. They give you water coffee or tea once. That is it. I'm so glad I had some snacks with me. You could buy something if you wanted. For a 6 hour flight they should give you something more. No nuts are anything extra. Really Oh if you wanted to watch a movie you had to pay for that too I will never fly with them again. This flight was booked by a travel agent. I have learned my lesson.,0
MXP-AUH-PEK INC-AUH-MXP. 3 of the 4 legs on 330-200 with latest business class product. Excellent seat perhaps a little narrow but flat and comfortable for seating and sleeping. Entertainment system very good service excellent very friendly and professional staff. INC-AUH on 340-500 with older business class (the old turquoise seats but recovered with the new stripy fabric clever move Etihad). More cramped and less room but still good for sleeping. No privacy separation between the 2 buddy seats in the middle and if you are not travelling with your companion then it would be embarrassingly close with a shared armrest. Food very good indeed and good wine selection. Would travel again with Etihad. Only negative comment the business class lounge at AUH is overcrowded as it the airport generally. I hope there are plans in place for improvement.,1
My wife and I flew on the Thomson Dreamliner - Gatwick to Puerto Plata (and back). We reserved seats 39G / J for both legs of our trip. These are great little seats despite the decrease recline. You still get more of a recline than you would on a normal flight so it's OK. The only issue is if the person in front of you reclines fully then the screen is at a slightly funky position. Both flights were pretty smooth (a little turbulence) and very comfortable. The food was decent - nothing spectacular but decent. We got 2 meals on both legs of the journey. Crew on the outbound flight were pretty poor - only did one run for drinks and had no authority - to the point where one man was standing up during landing. The flight home was shorter than scheduled which was appreciated and the lighting was very subtle. Really enjoyed both flights and look forward to flying the Dreamliner again.,1
"Travelled from Sydney to Delhi on 04 October AI301. Got a notice via email that flight was delayed by 20 minutes but the flight took off 2 hours late hence I missed my connecting flight. Requested an aisle seat they issued me a boarding pass with 15G when I was about to board the aircraft they gave my seat to another passenger without even consulting me and then they changed my seat to 12E. When I reached the aircraft I found a passenger sitting on 12E. I spoke to cabin staff who said they will look into it which they never did when I confronted her again she said sit wherever you can. I heard the staff suggesting to 2 passenger with same seat number to keep switching seats during the flight. I requested a special meal which they said they didn't have. When I reached Delhi Airport I was advised that my flight had left and will have to take another flight the next morning. They said they will arrange a hotel I waited for 2 hours for that to happen and I had to approach staff again to get this done. They took me to something that they called a hotel but it was ugly and under construction. I said I didn't want to stay there and they said we have another property. Entrance to that property was via the kitchen - I didn't even check the room and asked to be dropped back at Delhi Airport. I was made to sign a receipt of 2500Rs for the 30 minute stay at their hotel. All airlines are sometimes late flights get cancelled and all sorts of things happen but my problem with Air India was that no one had a slightest clue of what they were doing. When I spoke to the manager he said ""Do whatever you want"" I don't have authority to do anything and there is nothing that can be done tonight. India is a great nation and Air India brings shame to this great nation by associating itself with this great name. Absolutely irresponsible clueless and have no regard towards basic human feeling. Please don't travel Air India as I will never again.",0
SA8300 Johannesburg (South Africa) to Maun (Botswana) in Business Class. Check in took a very long time and was chaotic. Spacious and comfortable lounge at JNB Airport. Good food selection but I'm very disappointed in the selection of magazines and newspapers. I picked 3 newspapers but all of them were at least one week old. Why no fresh newspapers? For unknown reasons the aircraft had a delay of 40 minutes. Inflight service was worse. I ordered a special meal (vegetarian) and received a confirmation by mail but on board vegetarian meals were not available. I had nothing to eat. That's a shame especially when flying business class. In addition only one drink was served and the rest of the time the crew did not care about the passengers. The worst of all was that (afterwards) the SA-customer service told me that I didn't order a special meal while I had a confirmation of the ordered meal. Inflight entertainment was also worse no newspapers no screen no inflight magazine et c. Seats were quite comfortable but were just like economy seats. However the middle seats were also used in Business Class. Give me one reason why I should fly business class with SA? No meal not more seat space no priority check in etc. This is the second negative experience with SA. I will never fly South African Airways again.,0
Flew from New York to Greece through Geneva and returned through Zurich. Half the plane caters to business class. If you're flying economy you're out of luck. The economy class passengers are packed like sardines. No leg room and very tight seats. I'm a small person and I was very uncomfortable. I can't imagine how a larger frame person will be. I'm told that Airbus has nothing to do with the number of seats in a plane. Seats are installed based on the airline requests. An additional issue: I enrolled to the Star Alliance award program through United and Swiss would not credit the missing miles because the trip was already complete when I enrolled but their website does not indicate this. If I recommend Swiss is for the fair last minute booking price and no delays.,1
We booked our return trip LHR-BNE in August 2010 with China Airlines. We are due to depart from LHR on the 10/4/2011. Two days before our departure China airlines called and cancelled our flight due to the cancellation of the flight from Taipei to BNE. They didn't give us any reason and not even try to find us the alternative route. Although we have the full refund we have to find another airlines in the last minute. Luckily we are able to get on another airlines but it cost us Â£600 extra due to last minute fare. We are so disgusted with China Airlines and we would not recommend China Airlines to anyone. It is a joke that a 4-star airline provide such a terrible service.,0
Been using for years to fly from NAN to AKL CHC and SYD both in Economy and Business cabins. Service is still friendly however food quality has been declining. Now it is only a cold chicken or beef wrap but it used to be a full hot meal with a choice of two dishes. This is not good enough for what the airline is calling full service.,1
PR721 LHR-MNL 9 June 2014. Flight was on time and we arrived in Manila ahead of schedule. Return from Manila to London was on time as well. Great food service etc. I was very satisfied.,1
RUH-LHR Business class. Check in very slow - we were told to stand to one side although it was our turn to check in as a party of VIPS arrived with 40 cases. Lounge fine with good array of food and drinks. Internet stations and staff friendly. Full business class cabin with lie flat seats. AVOD good with plentiful selection of recent movies and programmes/games. Crew were efficient but very robotic - no smiles. Food average although plenty if it. All juices available and capuccino/espresso if wanted. Overall a good experience.,1
Outbound flight 0304 on 23/3/14 and return flight 0303 on 3/5/14. The flight was on time and was safely completed. That's the basics after all. Service was minimal and the cabin crew spent most of the flight chatting amongst themselves at the back of the plane. They came round twice each with drinks and food in the course of a thirteen hour flight. The food was right on the line as regards quality and quantity with very limited choice. The seat seemed to be the minimum size and was quite hard. The second-worst seat I have experienced as regards comfort. The charge for any excess baggage was Â£100 which I ended up paying on the return flight. Not impressed and will try to fly some other airline in future - maybe fly to Hong Kong and take a train into China.,0
Booked Shanghai to Xiamen flight on 28th December 2013 at 2.15pm. Checked in and settled in the business class lounge. As soon as we heard the flight started to board at around 1.45pm we started to move out of the Business Class lounge and made our way to the gate. It was a long walk so we got there at 2.00pm. Behold the plane was already starting to reverse! Asked the gate agent they said our luggage had already been taken out so we missed the flight! We had to book on to a different airline as we were going to a wedding that night. So stay close to the gate when catching flight in China even if you travel on business class. Will avoid them from now on.,0
My two short hops (IEV-SIP-IEV) on time and trouble free. Remarkably good crews tidy planes good seats but pitch tight. I didn't buy their snacks and drinks (rip off prices!). I realize that if something goes wrong low-cost would be take it or leave it but in my case I've got a good value for money. Airport handling in Zhulyany was really low cost experience but all worked and didn't cause any problem. Fight for seats didn't look great but wasn't so bad.,1
Swore I would never fly Flybe again - and I haven't. I have however booked 5 family members SOU-DUB return 16-19 Jul 13. The flight is not until tomorrow and already the frustration has mounted. The website does not work it simply bounces me back to the login screen. I can quote check in times of 20 mins 30 mins 1 hour and 2 hours per the website for the same data set! I have given up customer services premium rate telephone number several times after a 30 minute wait. I desperation I drove to Southampton today to resolve the issues so my guests could at least turn up at the correct time. I was greeted with no Flybe personnel at SOU they are represented by Servisair and you start with a desk manned by 2 and a queue in excess of 50. The Servisair supervisor was ill mannered and useless. The whole operation is ill conceived ill briefed and consequently ill executed - and expensive. It is my experience that poor systems and administrative procedures transcend to operations.,0
I will definitely not fly with Air Canada again. Had a previous bad experience with them and thought maybe give them another chance. Wife and I flew out of Paris from CDG. Boarded aircraft along with other 398 passengers and waited for over an hour for the plane to depart. No apologies nor explanations other than a brief P.A. about waiting for one late baggage. Plane arrived at Montreal one hour late and all passengers were not allowed to disembark due to some medical problem with one single person with another further delay of 20 minutes or so. We rushed to baggage claim to retrieve the check-ins then to an Air Canada connections kiosk. The clerk was extremely slow and seemed unsure how to process the transfer and became irritated when told that we were in a hurry to catch the 4 pm connector in 45 mins. She eventually told us that she would be placing us on a 8 pm connector instead. She became even more irate when asked for an explanation and merely told us to move on and just place the luggage on the conveyor. Another agent then came over and demanded us not to place the luggage on the conveyor as the flight was not until 8 pm and we were required to lug them around until further notice. While waiting for the connector - we spoke with a supervisor at an Air Can ticket counter and she explained that all passengers must be checked in 1 hour to departure hence we were placed on an 8 pm connector. At no time did any Air Canada staff members offer any apologies or help to alleviate the problem.,0
Return flight Melbourne to Cairns as family of 4 travelling with 2 kids under 2. Bags slightly overweight at check in lady told us we had to re-pack and then do the full line up again (about 45 min). We protested (just wanted to take things out right there and then instead of lining up again with 2 babies) and whilst she was gone to look for her manager took a couple of items out into hand luggage so weight was fine. She seemed surprised at us able to do it quickly and processed us. She just followed process but it wasn't very customer orientated nor efficient as we ended up waiting for her return as did everyone else in the line up. Return flight was fully booked with the exception of 1 seat which the check-in manager strategically placed between my husband and myself so we got 3 seats for the 4 of us which made all the difference (to us as we'll as the poor person who would have been sat next to us). Staff very friendly very reasonable fares pretty much on time both ways. Baggage claim on arrival in Melbourne tough as no staff around and 2 adults + 2 babies + suitcases + hand luggage + buggy and carseat difficult to get through gates without help. Had to ask other passengers for assistance. All in all great value for money!,1
"I will never fly Air Canada again. Before boarding, they warned us the toilet was inoperable. (Short flight, about 1.5 hours, so this is no big deal). While boarding, we had to leave our rollerboard ""carry-on's"" on the jetway, since the plane is too small to store them anywhere - the overhead bin is big enough for a laptop or purse. After boarding, we learned the air conditioning was half broken. I have never before been somewhere so hot and humid. Once we landed, we got to wait outside in the rain for our ""carry-on"" bags for 20 minutes, and several of us almost missed international connections because of this delay. In summary: no toilet, no air conditioning, and no carry-on bags.",0
Caught EK71 from Dubai to Paris and it was simply stunning. Staff were fantastic from start to finish food was great and I have no complaints whatsoever. This is one of the worlds great airlines and is really setting the standard for others to follow or not as is the case.,1
I recently flew Air Transat from Rome to Toronto. I was seated in a row quite near the washrooms. The washrooms were in constant use throughout the flight. At a point halfway through the flight a flight attendant replaced toilet tissue and kleenex. Other than that there was no attempt to clean the washrooms. At one point a father with a young son stood in the open washroom door and cleaned the toilet so that his child could use it. The washrooms became stinky as the flight went on. The passengers in the row ahead of me who were directly across from the washrooms were constantly reaching out from their seats to close the washroom door that was left open. All in all the whole experience was disgusting. Other public facilities with washrooms post a sheet on the inside door and staff are required to check off cleaning duties every hour. How can you expect a cubicle toilet to remain clean over a 9 hour flight when it is in constant use. I expect a clean washroom on my flights. Air Transat offers perks like inflight shopping wine and beverage service etc. Surely they could offer clean washroom facilities as a priority.,0
I flew from LA to Amsterdam. The service and entertainment was excellent. They had many options for movies and music! There was no need for me to ask the staff for anything since it was offered to me. The staff were friendly attentive and courteous. I had the best yoghurt I have had as well my favorite alcoholic drink. My economy class truly felt like premium economy or business class.,1
March 2014: KL 672 and KL 671 - Montreal to AMS and back on the old MD11 in business. The seats are old and I am looking forward to October 2014 when the MD11 will be replaced. However service on this route is always good. Dedicated staff easy going and attentive.,1
MNL-ZAM return. Fairly new A320 well-maintained tight seat pitch but adequate. Flights on time with good information from flight deck. Cabin crew efficient: on domestic flights only tea/coffee and nibbles are offered. Generally a good in-flight experience. On the ground check-in staff are strict on weight - expect to pay if you have in excess of 15kg hold baggage for domestic flights. Also have local currency to pay the 200 peso departure tax at all airports. Overall the flight experience compared very favourably with domestic and regional flying in UK and Europe.,1
Flew KWI-BEY good food drink and service however could use a more polite crew. Whenever I needed a request they took a huge amount of time to take the request and bring it to me. Not a good entertainment system most of the time it was broken and didn't have the shows promised on the website. Roomy seats however and good catering. I would suggest for the benefit of this airline is to improve the entertainment system. Because check-in was quick and the ground handling was great. Just improve the entertainment system and everything would be perfect.,1
Hong Kong to Narita B777-300ER. The seat is comfortable and one of the best in the world. Boarding was quick and economy seats were plush and comfy. Cabin crew were excellent as always. People who aren't happy with Economy Class service must have been spoilt by First Class too much.,1
Business class Moscow to Chisinau. I was the only business class passenger. Good condition A320. Flight was on time FA was smart pretty smiling and hospitable. Cabin service was fine - a full breakfast served and service was attentive. I was pleasantly surprised.,1
Flew from JFK in New York to Madrid. The 10.05 pm flight took off at 2.20 am. Flew from Barcelona to Madrid. The 12.05 pm flight took off at 4 pm and fortunately the 5.35 flight from Madrid to JFK was also about an hour late so we didn't miss our connection. Needless to say the experience was terrible and the on ground support was poor. Nobody could explain the delays or even when the plane would be ready to take off. The messages posted about departures never change so that regardless when the flight boarded and was scheduled to depart only the original information appeared. In addition our dietary requests - made far enough in advance were ignored on the flight to Spain but honored on the return trip.,0
We flew business from Melbourne to Bangkok via Brunei within the last month. Decided to fly business as the price was better than others on the same route. In perspective it offered good service for the money. The Cathay Pacific lounge in Melbourne is adequate and comfortable. On boarding you are offered a drink (non-alcoholic of course) and hot (very hot) towel. Shortly after take off you are given a menu to mark what you want and then offered a series of magazines etc. The entertainment system worked fine the selection adequate. Meals were huge you could have five courses then snacks also if you wished. The service was excellent going with less in the cabin (business) but coming back it was full and the two people serving were struggling. I asked for a duvet instead of a meal coming back and I was eventually given that when the meal service was complete which was not my aim (I wanted to sleep through service). Anyway it was fine really the price was right and it was a comfortable easy flight. The staff are very nice Brunei airport is small but functional. Arriving our bags were first off which was very nice and on arriving back in Melbourne were given a fast pass but that didn't matter as the plane was the first international that landed.,1
Very poor quality service. Lack of in seat entertainment on 5 hour flights even in Business class is simply unacceptable in this day and age. I was also refused access to a lounge on an international business class seat because my son in a wheelchair was flying economy on a school trip. Basic customer service would have seen the airline allow us to enter the lounge.,0
Flown LAN many times over the years beginning when it was a one class airline flying old 737s. Never had a bad flight bad meal or bad treatment. I've purchased tickets 30 minutes before departure and have been granted discounts on the spot based on published discounts. The Fly Chile pass is a great bargain. I have only flown coach so I cannot speak to the other classes. One flight La Paz Bolivia to Santiago after a back packing trip found our group 300 pounds over weight. They waived the charges. That flight which stopped in Iquique for customs served a full meal with wine (45 minute flight). I do miss the wicker baskets full of warm bread. Travelers inside So America should understand that the Chilean breakfast is bread cheese and sliced ham though that's probably changing.,1
"BRU-DXB on Boeing 777-300 in Business class. The check in was good,  and you get a fast pass through security and passports. They share a lounge with other airlines but it was ok with nice views over the runway. The flight was good with good service from the attentive staff who knew our names and occasionally stopped to chat. The food choices were good, good Moet champagne and a lot of drinks options with good aged spirits. The seats are is 2-3-2 and we always try to prebook 2 together by the window. ICE entertainment system is excellent, probably the best in the air, and very good noise cancelling headphones. The seat is comfortable with a perfect preset recline position but you can adjust it how you want or lie-flat. They provide a mattress if you want to sleep. DXB-BKK on the A380. The Business cabin is nearly all the top deck apart from 3 rows of First in the front. The seat arrangement is staggered so if you want to sit together your only choice is in the middle so you won't get a window seat. However these seats are surrounded by furniture so you're away from the aisle so very cosy. The service was excellent and the staff seemed happy to serve. The seat is different but just as comfortable and of course lie-flat. It has the same ICE system. However the beauty of the A380 is the bar or inflight lounge with it's long, comfy seats and plenty of standing area. Both flights were on time and you get a fast pass to avoid the long queues at passports in BKK and your bags have priority so will be out before you. And Emirates provide a free chauffeur service into Bangkok, we had a nice Mercedes.",1
Hands down worst customer service of any airline/company. I first attempted to call their customer service line to resolve my problem and everytime I called there was a 45+ minute wait so I emailed instead. Keep in mind it takes them 3-4 days to respond to emails (which I find unacceptable) so I tried to work it out with them for a few weeks. Following my initial complaint the customer service rep went in and deleted all my airline miles I had accumulated seeing as how my initial contact with them was resolving and issue on using them. Second they didn't even bother to tell me they deleted the miles they tried to play me for being ignorant and said I had no miles. Three weeks of battling with them they have restored part of my points and refuse to assist with my initial issue of using the points. Absolutely worst customer service ever!,0
Flight to Curacao in economy class. I never had such a bad flight with unfriendly staff. The one free meal was bad for the rest you have to pay. Seat was very narrow. For menever again with Arkefly.,0
FRA-PRG-TLV return. CSA offers very competitive fares to TLV. Check in in FRA took a little time since only 2 counters open. A319 seats a little slim and not very comfy. Small sweet or salty snack and drinks served on this short sector. IFE was overhead LCD screens showing CSA commercials and map. Connecting in PRG very easy. Airport nice look out for a brochure with coupons for the airport restaurants. CSA offers upgrades for appox 40 EUR to business class (subject to have a high economy booking class or a frequent flyer status). PRG-TLV was full on A320. Seats not very comfy and felt quite cramped. Served a small hot meal and not very good. TLV to FRA they were overbooked and offered to rebook me to a direct El Al flight which I accepted. Check in staff at TLV very friendly and efficient. I would fly Czech Airlines again if the price is low the product is nothing special but they did the job and flights were on time.,1
Flew BA from Toronto to New Delhi via London in Premium Economy class in August. First leg was on a 787 plane was nice but definitely does not have nearly enough toilets on board. Premium Economy passengers have quite a walk to the nearest lavatory (bad bad design). On board service was very good staff were great food was good. Next leg from London to New Delhi was on a 777 much better in my opinion that the Dreamliner primarily as it has better toilet facilities. Again staff and service were top notch. Our return trip in October was made with our newborn baby. If anything the service was even better than on our first leg. Thankfully we had a 777 on both legs and not the Dreamliner. Staff were incredibly helpful and accommodating making a fuss about the baby and really always there to help. Again the food and beverage service was very good. The seat reclining buttons were a bit stiff but other than that the seats were OK not excellent but definitely comfortable enough. Considering that I hadn't flown BA for over ten years before these flights (due to bad service) I was really pleasantly surprised by the improved level of service provided by the airline. Yes being in Premium Economy helped but I was very satisfied comparing it to Virgin Atlantic's Premium Economy which I have regularly used. Well done BA you made a trip that we were dreading actually quite a pleasant experience and I'm likely to fly BA again now.,1
YYZ-WAW with a stop in FRA. FRA-WAW portion was operated by a LO E-175 aircraft. This was on July 24 2013. After arriving from the connection flight from YYZ I went to the boarding gate and waited. The check-in process was efficient and smooth and the Polish cabin crew were friendly and welcoming (the younger flight attendant serving the drinks in my area was not as friendly but still pleasant). I was pleased with the wide array of drinks available on the flight as there were even plenty of alcoholic options. A sandwich was provided which was to my surprise very good and quite plentiful. The flight landed right on time at WAW and in general I thought it to be a great flight. The spoken English of the flight attendants could be a bit better but apart from that I though t it to be a great flight with nice and friendly service. I wouldn't hesitate to fly LOT again.,1
LCY-Berne Berne-Lugano return. Check-in at all 3 airports was friendly quick and efficient. Onboard service was great and reminiscent of early Crossair but with a Ticino flavour (individual quality rolls/pastries and bottomless prosecco!). The flight BRN-LUG was memorable as we flew lower level over/through the Alps. Return flight faultless and on time.,0
BKK-CMB-FRA return in business class. On all flights except the CMB-FRA sector we had their new lie flat business class seats. It was quite upsetting that this configuration was not available on the long CMB-FRA flight moreover as this was a red-eye flight. Check-in in BKK quick and efficient given priority passes for security and immigration. Lounge in BKK is Air France - quite sterile and no real food. Service on board was excellent delicious meal served. IN CMB boarded from the bus gate air conditioning not working and business class boarded last - weird! Luggage in FRA came out last despite being tagged priority. On the return flight quick check-in at FRA. UL is using the JAL lounge - quite poor choice of food available. Great dinner on board but not sure why they serve a 2nd dinner just before a 5am arrival in CMB. Serendib lounge in CMB closed due to renovation used another old fashioned lounge but was quite ok. Flight to BKK left 30 mins late. Delicious breakfast served on board. Entertainment on all flights quite a joke. Choice extremely limited and the AVOD system in business class is almost impossible to navigate. Luggage in BKK came out first. UL business class product clearly has some shortcomings but given that the ticket is only nominally more expensive than an economy class ticket on some other airlines it is still a good choice and value for money.,1
Traveled for the first time with Air India - MEL-DEL on 20th Sept 2013. I must say I was very impressed with service. Crew were excellent and so was the food. Dreamliner aircraft didn't disappointed me at all. Every need was attended to with attention.,1
CCS-HAV-CCS. Received 2 emails a week before the flights that both departure times changed and had to change connection flight on the return. Arrived 4 hrs early to make sure the time wasn't going to change again but the flight was not listed on the departure board. 30 mins before we were supposed to take off there was a line to an unmarked check-in counter next to where we were told to wait finally check-in and told to go to gate 21B which doesn't exist but we all wait in the area of gate 21. 3 hrs later we are escorted to a bus that drives 10 mins away from the airport to an abandoned air strip. Ended up getting to Cuba around midnight and again they drive the bus away from the main terminal to another out of the way receiving area. Lost a day and gained unwanted stress on the way there.,0
Two return flights on Brussels-Sofia route. One on a clean A319 the other Embraer 190. Staff friendly and helpful good selection of drinks onboard. Sandwiches were not bad at all. If tall try to get an aisle seat next to the emergency exit in the middle of the plane. As another review mentioned online check-in is limited only to flights taking off from Sofia which is a lack in these times. All in all not a bad service and I'll fly again.,1
I was quite sceptical about flying Jet Airways after reading all the negative reviews so I was pleasantly surprised on both legs of my flight Singapore-Delhi-Singapore. The plane was clean seats comfortable food very good and inflight entertainment excellent. The staff were attentive and were there when needed. If this is the standard then I will definitely fly with Jet Airways again.,1
"July 22, 2015 Allegiant Air's Flight 548 (LAS-BIL) was delayed 5hrs. Aircraft finally at departure gate A12 and passengers were informed by Gate Agents that boarding would commence as soon as replacement Flight Crew arrived. Passengers stood in boarding line for 1/2 hour when Gate Agents redirected passengers to gate A14, where there was no aircracft. Same gate Agent announced to passengers at gate A10, in line to go to Eugene OR. that their new gate of departure would be A12. Allegiant Air gave the aircraft away and cancelled ultimately cancelled Fight 548. Allegiant Air gave no reasons for cancellation and did not provide commodations or alternate air travel for that date. Fare refunded for that segment.",0
DXB-IKA. A300-600 aircraft clean cabin with friendly flight attendants variety of meals were good but the quality of meal was very poor.,1
Flight from ICN-DXB-MAD. Everything was fine except its cabin crew. Some were rude and never smiled. Dubai Airport is awful. It is just a shopping center with zero possibility to see the airport apron.,1
Flight delayed more than 3 hours so I missed an important meeting. Earlier notice would have given me time to find an alternative. The staff didn't even try to help and find a solutions. The food inflight was inedible. The entertainment system was ridiculous and included a poor quality public screen. The flight price was extremely high compare to the value.,0
Delta is extremely frustrating to deal with! We took a family vacation to Alaska. There were 8 of us and we had two stops each way. I reserved seats when I booked the flights. When I checked in online for every flight for all 8 of us I found that all of the seats had been changed for every flight! We were on a family vacation and I picked seats for a reason. The answer I got every time I called was that they switch planes a lot and the seats don't match. I can't imagine that all of the planes were changed! I hope that I never have to fly Delta again! They need to take lessons from Alaska and Southwest!,0
Paris CDG to Tokyo Narita via Incheon airport. Good service and leg room satisfying but besides that there is not enough to justify the ranking of this airline. Their website is terrible. Airport ground staff are not friendly and most of all this company allows only one luggage of 20kg in Eco or 30kg in Business - one piece of luggage is just outrageous for the price paid. The 747 was outworn with tired seats inflight entertainment was ridiculously small old and content simply not viewable. I fly often and Asiana really just didn't make the cut this time next to Emirates Singapore Thai and Qatar.,0
Booked flights to Kathmandu via Delhi as did my niece - the outbound journey was a nightmare. We are both registered disabled with mobility problems - at Heathrow check-in we were promised 3 seats in order for us to stretch our legs. On both flights we were given 1 seat each rows apart with hardly any leg room. The seatbelt light was kept on most of the 1st long-haul flight so we weren't able to stand or use the toilet for hours at a time. The trip back was a dream the cabin crews were so attentive and on the Delhi to London leg we were both given 4 seats at the back so we could lie down. My advice to anyone with a disability would be to email customer services prior to booking detailing your needs. To anyone else I'd say Jet Airways isn't too bad considering the reasonable price of flights if you're a fussy eater and don't like spicy food take a packed lunch and take a cushion as the seats aren't very comfy.,1
"I flew from Sydney to Bali. The seats are uncomfortable the inflight entertainment screen was too close and of a poor selection the seating / leg room was uncomfortably small (I am only 62 kgs and 1.67 tall ). On flight back from Bali to Sydney the air con was blowing icy cold air onto my neck and when I requested a blanket I was told that I did not choose the ""pamper Pack"" at $10 I did not want pampering but just protect myself from this cold blast. Too much take and no give with this airline. The cabin crew were not accommodating at all. I do fly to Bali once or twice a year and this was my first JetStar flight to that destination never again. They are ok for short flights within Australia but do not have the class for passengers to endure a longer trip.",0
I was impressed with LUXAIR. My flights were on-time and the FAs were great. CDG to LUX EMBRAER RJ145. Typical commuter terminal set-up. Take a bus to get there. Boarded from the tarmac. Reminds me of LAX. Plane has 1x2 seating. Fancy turquoise and black flight attendant uniforms for such a short flight in a small aircraft. Plane did have a special 2005 EU Presidency decal outside the cabin hatch. Lovely little brunch service. China and stamped metal flatware. Fruit cup rye roll croissant cute soufflÃ© thing on a toast mozzarella bacon. Got a box of two chocolates at the end. Unfortunately my checked bags weren't there. I wasn't the only one to groan when the baggage carousel stopped without barfing out my bag. The checked bag arrived over 5 hours after I did. LUX to FRA Boeing 737-500. Nice Luxair VIP lounge. It's got a self serve espresso machine that grinds the beans fresh and dried fruit packaged snacks cute little sandwiches and bottled drinks. Plane is interesting. First class seating is almost the same as coach. The armrests on the center seat angle inward and a console goes on top with places for drinks. It looks they can sell as many business class seats as they want. A third of the plane looked like it was set up for business class! Seats are a little low. Seemed harder to get my carry-on under there. Leg room is okay. It didn't seem like there was much if any additional space between seat . They gave out packaged hand wipes and there were sandwiches on nice crusty bread for the snack. Impressive computer animated pre-flight safety video. Has video screen every 4 rows that retract up. Showed graphic of plane location during the flight.,0
Good aircraft with comfortable seating. Late night flight so the sleep factor is crucial. A light meal provided after takeoff and a good breakfast before landing. A bit of turbulence till we crossed over Myanmar. Cabin crew very attentive and helpful. Toilets were clean though limited amenities; no hand-sanitizers or hand lotion available.,1
Poor service. Additional drinks also during the meals you will get them only at request. Flight attendants were not offering any service. In the bathrooms only the most essential articles are available.,0
Kos-Athens-LHR on October 1st at 19.10hrs. Very professional service. The airline offered sweets on take-off small snack and drink on Kos-Athens which is just a 40 minute flight! The drinks service are repeated twice on Athens-LHR flight and the meals are adequate. Well worth Â£70 one way and into Heathrow! I would definitely fly them again. Seating is okay for 3 hours 30 minutes and flight seems to go fast as the cabin crew are constantly busy with the passengers. Probably a budget IFE system needs adding for a little more enjoyment!,1
"DXB-MNL MNL-DXB - as what the brand suggests ""Budget Airline"" so don't expect a five star service. Nevertheless the cabin is clean staff are friendly food are good (Chicken Adobo and Beef Caldereta).",1
VIE-BKK-VIE in Business Class. New seats are a significant step up from the previous product. Had 3A on the way out and 7K back and the seats had excellent room lots of space for storage and comfortable for sleeping fully flat and relaxing. Topped off by the excellent food and beverage service with a trolley bringing out soup and 2 other starters 3 hot options and 2 desserts plus ice cream. A standard of food service you don't see on business class elsewhere. Only bettered by the coffee service with about 10 different coffee combinations on offer. The in flight entertainment screens are large and responsive with the only disappointment being the extremely small selection. I didn't mind as both flights left just before midnight so after dinner it was time for sleep. Service from the crew was excellent. Austria's only weak point in the past was the angled lie-flat seats now it has seats that are up there with the best. I'd easily choose Austrian over any other carrier in long haul business class.,1
Paris-Johannesburg Economy. A380 upper deck. Comfortable seats excellent entertainment program and the best food in Economy I have had in years. Everything on time flight attendants were offering water several times through the flight. Real headphones not the 50 cent cheapos that sound like a tin can. Again very good breakfast. Absolutely no complaints almost perfect for economy long-distance.,1
Flew to Cologne from LHR - return flight had to be diverted back to Cologne due to technical difficulties - over 2 hours after the original departure time we were told to embark after which having endured a 15 minute wait on an unmanned bus in minus 6 degrees we were told the replacement flight was delayed for catering to be loaded. Eventually left 3 hrs 15 mins late. Promised complaint forms never materialised. Will avoid this airline in future at all costs and at Â£327 for 2 hardly a budget price.,0
Ouagadougou to Gatwick - the plane which was due to leave Ouaga at 1.00 am arrived at 4am & departed at 5am. I asked one of the ground staff before departure if I could possible catch the connecting flight at Tripoli which was due to leave at 8.30 am considering that it was a 4 hours flight to Tripoli and 2 hours time difference in advance. I was reassured more than once that I will catch the plane and even a message had been sent to wait for me there. I boarded the plane with a lot of apprehension and when we arrived at Tripoli I was not surprised to find that the plane had left without me 2 hrs earlier. I contacted Afriqiyah staff and they looked embarased and didn't know what to do with me - I had to stay in the airport lounge till the next day when one of the staff took somehow pity on me & upgraded my ticket to the first class. Food is not bad inflight service good and 48 kg baggage allowance for somehow modest ticket price.,0
I've only flown with this airline on two flights. One towards my destination and the flight back. Despite being days apart both flights were delayed 3-4 hours causing me to miss my connecting flight back home which forced me to stay another day in Vietnam missing a day of work having to pay for an extra day of accommodations plus re- booking my flight home. They will not compensate you for anything. The rates are cheap but I ended up paying so much more for the amount of trouble the delays have caused. Fly at your own risk.,0
Last flew with Ryanair 10th and 15th Aug 2014 LPL-BCN-LPL. Excellent flights both ways - an unexpected bonus was getting premium seats and priority boarding at no extra cost when we checked in online two days before flying. Cabin crew courteous and friendly and both flights although each about 10 mins late pushing back from stand landed on time. Use Ryanair about 12 times a year and have never had a bad flight except for one (MAN-FAO Feb 2014) which was delayed because of storms which affected all flights to Southern Europe that evening. Crew were trying to be helpful but abusive and drunken behaviour from a mixed group of twenty something's caused us to miss our revised take-off slot while the police removed them. As long as you read the website carefully and follow the booking and check-in instructions Take a bit of responsibility for your own arrangements then there shouldn't be a problem - although it never ceases to amaze me how many people forget to pack their brains when they travel.,1
BHX-FRA on a BAE 146. Generally good flight on time. BAE 146 slow and seats very narrow. A 3-3 configuration on this type is ridiculous. If the middle seat is occupied it is very cramped. Legroom is adequate though. Usual service of a small cheese sandwich and a drink perfectly adequate. Staff friendly. Seatbelt light stayed on for the entire flight for no apparent reason but people ignored it. Parked at a remote stand at FRA which involves busing. Overall good. It beats driving to Heathrow or Gatwick if you live in the Midlands and you fly to the real Frankfurt not an airfield 100 miles away. Cheaper than Ryanair too.,0
First time experience with Austrian Airlines. Two flights two consecutive days. The first one was delayed 70 minutes the second one - 150 minutes. These changed completely my business schedule. I would rather arrange my travel to a different day just to avoid Austrian Airlines.,0
Flew SYD-OOL-SYD last weekend. It departed on time both directions cabin crew pleasant and efficient. Took only cabin allowance baggage and did web check in no problems at all. Will fly Tiger again good value for ticket price paid.,1
After 7 hours of delays canceled flight rescheduled flight for following morning 6 hours of delays - zero explanation and horrendous customer service.,0
I recently flew United from Shanghai to Chicago on B747-400 in Global First seat 2A. This airline is a disaster. First the boarding. Group 1 which includes first class had about 90 people in Shanghai with the line stretching down the corridor. In fact there were more people in group 1 than in group 4 or 5. So much for First Class. The front cabin of B747 is old and dirty. Seat 2A has more privacy than most but overall the first class cabin is tight with very little privacy and people on top of each other. The seat is long and comfortable and you can sleep. The flight attendants?? one was pleasant and the other really did not care about anything. The food was horrible cold appetizer awful salad. The food lack warmth/taste/presentation. Breakfast was down right disgusting. Maybe this is because on the way to China I flew with ANA and the service is excellent and incomparable. Flying United is not really a first class experience in any shape or form.,0
We booked our tickets on Spicejet with a travel agent in Surat on August 2009 for travel January 2010 for Goa to Mumbai flight in the afternoon so some of us can catch a flight back to US from Mumbai that night. As we were standing in line at Goa airport for more than an hour they took down the Mumbai sign at the check in counter. On inquiry the check in person told us the flight was cancelled and the fare will be refunded to the travel agent- no other assistance or help. We had to scramble to GoAir counter to get to Mumbai before we are no show at the international flight. GoAir charged us INR 45951 for 7 tickets to Mumbai. Spicejet is irresponsible in its policies and attitude. They left 200+ international passengers in limbo at a place without accomodation or any other help. In light of our experience I would advise anyone with any plans for further travel to stay away from booking their tickets on Spicejet unless they want to jeopardize their plans and wallet!,1
LIS-GIG in business on A330. Flight left and arrived on time. Plane was in good shape and the crew very friendly good service throughout flight. Seat was comfortable food on board was good. Excellent Portuguese wines (the exception being the sparkling which I did not like). Only negative item was the vintage IFE which consisted of only 4 channels in 2 languages each on which showed various movies in a loop.,1
Bangkok to Manchester return via Doha 12th and 19th September. The new Doha airport is of course a great improvement on the old one but some issues still continue: checking into the flight at the gate meant pushing 250 people into a space designed for probably 100 rather an unseemly start - it wasn't possible so many of us had to wait until some had got on the plane. The privilege club silver lounge was hard to find ??I was sent from one lounge to the next [visiting 4 in all] before I found the right one - the staff seemed confused about who could use which lounge. Now that Qatar have joined One World I may change to Finnair as their prices and travel times are better than Qatar. All in all Qatar is a good product.,1
Flew Air Asia India from Bangalore to Chennai. Check-in smooth and efficient. Boarding completed before time and pushback 10 minutes ahead of schedule. New and clean aircraft manned by an efficient cockpit and cabin crew. Landed in Chennai 30 minutes ahead of schedule. Looking forward to them expanding to more destinations within India.,1
LAX-JFK-KEF return Comfort + on all four segments. The Sky Priority boarding and extra legroom were a real plus but the DL Comfort + seating does not compare to BA Premium Economy. The Levo wraps and frozen yoghurt bars on the two transcontinental flights were 100 times better than the coach dinner and lunch served on the two international segments. Appreciated the open bar on all four flights but not the wine from a box on JFK-KEF. The cabin crews were friendly and professional on all four flights and there was no wait for luggage in either KEF or LAX. The ancient 767 on the final JFK-LAX leg was too warm had poor ventilation and the VOD lacked the live Dish TV option. Boarding for JFK-LAX was chaotic.,1
It has been a long-haul transatlantic flight in a new 747-8. The baggage drop security check flight and arrival have been uneventful and ok. The service onboard was good but not outstanding. After less than ten rows serviced the choice of meals was already reduced to one (pasta). The quality is comparable to supermarket convenience food and tends to be lower than in previous years - in variety as well as in general quality.,1
Shanghai - Beijing First Class. Good flight first class ticket was less than a normal economy ticket. Airport lounge was busy but had plenty of fresh coffee finger food snacks and newspapers. Bussed directly from the lounge when boarding air-crew were pleasant. Overall a really good flight.,1
"A friend and I had to go to Kozhikode in April 2014 for my brother's wedding. We came from Dubai and had to take the 11.35 flight from Mumbai to Kozhikode on 8 April 2014. The function was at 18:30 the same evening. We approached the check-in counter well in advance at 9:45 and made to wait for about 20 minutes without being told why. We're then told the flight is overbooked and were asked to wait until 11:00. At 11:00 told that we cannot board the flight because it is overbooked. Overbooking flights is understandable. Most airlines do it. However with Jet Airways we were given a bad alternative considering our situation ""compensation"" of INR 3000 and told to take the 13:25 flight to Kochi and a 5 hour drive to Kozhikode from there. Not the best option for 2 girls who aren't familiar with the city. And guess what we face the inconvenience and we pay and arrange for all this. We were told that they would approach passengers to find out if anyone is willing to give up their seats. As it turns out this was not true because we had another friend on the same flight who mentioned this situation to passengers who were indeed willing to give up their seats. We were told that we would be assisted by Jet Airways staff at the Kochi airport with the taxi bookings. Didn't happen. While overbooking flights is normal the way Jet Airways handled this situation is unacceptable. At the end of it we had the impression that they did not take us seriously at the Mumbai airport. Very bad service at the Mumbai airport and non-existent service at Kochi airport. Unless I have absolutely no choice I would never choose this airline again.",0
VA 43 Brisbane to Bali June 6. Flight delayed by approx 30 minutes due to crewing. Flight 90% full. We were fortunate to have purchased exit row seats so had a reasonable amount of space for the 6+ hour flight. Crew performed well under difficult circumstances (only 2 toilets at rear of the 787-800 - hence long queues and galley at rear of the aircraft). Food average and some beverages ran out. In-flight wifi entertainment adequate Due to the flying time and therefore comfort this route may be better served by VA with a larger aircraft as Jetstar now operates the 787 to this destination out of Brisbane.,1
Having travelled from Tel Aviv to Madrid and back for several years now and though I always preferred El-Al for this route Iberia pilots are very good. I have noticed an improvement in staff attitude in the past two flights (flight attendants used to be so impolite now it is mostly friendly) . English proficiency should be dramatically improved though. Food was also a little better on my last flights. If they carry on the good job I will definitely recommend Iberia.,1
FRA-DME-OVB. FRA to DME was very good staff could have spoken english. This is the only gripe I have with the FRA-DME leg of the trip the DME - OVB leg however was worse. DME airport was packed I was charged for overweight baggage - even though I was within the limits. Their staff at DME don't speak English and I had to run to the gate. The flight was delayed by an hour because the FRA-DME flight was delayed (and customs took well over an hour). The plane to Novosibirsk was scary to say the least. The only way I can describe it is as a flying train. No overhead bins in the middle aisle staff didn't speak english seats were all torn and well past their life.,0
AMD-HYD return quite happy with the product. New B737-800. Were offered soft drinks & peanuts on a 1 hr 15 min. flight. FAs attentive and efficient. On-time performance both ways. Can't really fault the offering. I'd rate it as above average LCC experience.,0
"I flew First Class on UA14 HNL-EWR. The plane was clean and the entertainment system was excellent. The food however was inedible. What they called ""chicken cacciatore"" was really a piece of cardboard. I have had better food in Coach on other airlines. Service on the flight was de minimus. The flight crew seemed only interested in finishing the pitiful dinner service as quickly as possible. Nobody flies for the food but United sets the bar for the worst food and catering in the industry. I thought Delta had poor food (which they do) but by comparison they look pretty good.",0
"LX1254 from ZRH-ARN January 20 2014 in Premium Economy. The aircraft used on this service was an Airbus A320 and I was seated in the last row (36F). Since this is a code-share flight with SAS Scandinavian Airlines and I was booked on a SK-flight number you are normally only offered a middle-seat by Swiss unless you select to sit in the the last couple of rows in the airplane which I did. (Gave me a row on myself). The experience with Swiss on Intra-European routes is by no means anything extraordinary. The comfort of the seats are resonably ok but basically the same type of relatively uncomfortable Recaro seats you will find on the other Star Alliance Partners within Europe (Austrian Lufthansa). The Airbus A320-series of Swiss have an in-flight entertainment system with the first generation of screens sliding down from the overhead bins. What is shown on the screens are however so so. Even in economy you are offered free drinks and a snack. On this flight we were offered a ""Tasteful Italian Pizza Slide"". Exactly the same pizza slide has been offered for the last three years while I have regularly been travelling on this specific route. I can tell you that the pizza slide is indeed not especially tasteful! To summaries really nothing to complain about but not a special experience.",1
Madrid to SCL0. I do this route on a regular basis and one of the more pleasant long hauls you will find in economy class. This flight benefits from extended darkness which reduces cabin activity from most passengers right until the last hour or so. Cabin crew efficient and attentive and have the extraordinary nature of working in total silence when dealing with requests for drinks. Self service for snacks in economy a real bonus and plenty available. Water and juice rounds plentiful. The best to South America.,1
Flew Air Malta to Rome. Outward flight was cancelled by Air Malta with the reason that there was an airport strike in Rome Fiumicino. Interestingly enough there was another flight to Rome Fiumicino with another airline departing an hour later that left as scheduled without any delays etc. Air Malta offered re-routing on another of their flights departing 8 hours later but did not give us any vouchers for meals or snacks or rerouting on an earlier flight with another airline as stipulated by EU law. According to them it was not their fault that the flight was cancelled and therefore we were not entitled to anything. Check-in staff helpful both in Malta and Rome Staff at ticketing desk and cabin crew could not care less about our situation or about the passengers in general. The flights were rather uneventful. Meals can be hardly called dinner or lunch as they consisted of half a sandwich and a small water container (100ml). On the way back we had stopover in Reggio Calabria airport which took about an hour during which about 20 passengers got off and on the aircraft. Would not recommend Air Malta for this route as it is currently being served by much more competitive airlines offering direct routes.,0
BKK-AUH-AMS on 1 Sep 2014 AMS-AUH-BKK on 18 Sep 2014. Passengers will fly Etihad and discover: uninspired cabin service narrow seats rude cabin staff (yes coming from a Dutchman) poor on-time performance an absolute joke of an airline hub have written a separate review on the Airport headings. When you pay extra for exit row seats legroom don't sit in the window seat. It has a horizontal bit of door perfect for stretching out your legs (shoes removed of course) but the stewardess will wake you up by shaking your shoulder forbidding you to do this citing a safety issue with the door. There is a sticker on that door bit saying ?Do not sit here??something I was not doing. Meal choice was run down to one choice only every meal. The seats on the B777 were painfully narrow painful for me but particularly for the overweight lady being wedged in the chair next to me. Will I fly this airline again - no thank you. Garuda was a much better experience and at least the Jakarta airport personnel were endearingly inefficient by smiling a lot.,0
Brunei-Kota Kinabalu. Very short flight on A319. On time. The business class cabin had a total of two rows (8 seats). Seats are comfortable with lots of legroom. Cabin crew were friendly. Some fruit juice was served prior to departure but there was no meal/drink service during that short flight. The business class lounge at Brunei airport was quite nice with not a bad choice of warm/cold food and drinks.,1
I traveled from Washington D.C to Bangalore India. Never again will I make such a mistake! Checking in our bags at Dulles the ground staff were overly picky about the weight per bag not he total weight per passenger so I was there along with innumerable folks re-packing my suitcases. Then the hand baggage was weighed - not once but 3 times the last one being just before we got on the plane. This staff member came with a portable weighing scale and rechecked. When I got on the flight it was literally empty same thing with the return flight. I will never fly on this airline again.,0
LAX-PDG PDG-LAX and a few domestic flights in China. Seats were comfortable on the transpacific flight and electrical outlets at every seat. The IFE was strange so a laptop comes in handy. Meals were hot and tasty but expect Asian-style cuisine. Obviously FA's speak little English but ours seemed friendly. They brought out hot towels after each meal which was a pleasant surprise. Domestic flights were pleasant and uneventful. Only issue was when a storm the previous night caused out flight to be cancelled. We would have been out of luck if our Chinese-speaking guide hadn't been there to speak with the agents.,1
Rome to Constanta. A slight delay on the second leg of the flight due to bad weather affecting the incoming connection. Food Ok and service fine basically you got what you paid for and no complaints from me would use them again.,0
KUL-DPS 737. DPS-KUL 777. Very odd seat layout on the 777 2x5x2 which I've never seen before. Sandwiches looked revolting both ways didn't even unwrap them. Rudest stewardesses I've ever seen surly abrupt and when the people opposite me requested blankets they were practically thrown at them. I can only assume their long haul product is in a different league.,0
BKK-CAI Business class. A terrible experience. Star Alliance standards? The flight was terrible an extremely old 777 with economy class legroom and no proper recline. Only 21 seats and no service. I asked for juice and the empty glass was in the arm rest for only 8 hours. Not even once a cabin attendant asked if needed something. A third class breakfast was served. I cannot understand how Egypt air was accepted to Star Alliance with such a low standards.,0
Washington Dulles to Toronto. Had made online seat selection. Seat confirmed at check-in and issued boarding pass. Then boarding pass checked at gate again. Went to seat and found another passenger who had same seat issued. Flight attendant was not very pleasant and had us wait while she boarded other passengers. Fortunately another seat was available. How can 3 different seat checks miss a double seat booking?,0
I flew Spirit Airlines on April 18 from PDX to ORD. I flew them before several times so I knew the rules of online checking and printing the boarding pass at home only bring a small backpack to avoid luggage fees and have them select the seats for you in order to avoid paying extra. The plane was new although the seat space is the smallest in the industry. There is no entertainment so bring your own. Food and water costs extra so bring your own. Carry-ons cost extra so don't bring any. Check in online at home and print your boarding pass and save the $10 it costs to do at the kiosk at the airport. Just bring a backpack like I did and you don't have to pay any luggage fees. We took off early and arrived into Chicago early. Since I have their credit card I was able to redeem 5000 miles and pay just $13.10 for the one way ticket to Chicago. I can't emphasize enough how you must know what the fees are when you fly this airline. All the complaints come from people who did not do their homework and then have to pay at the airport. Spirit Airlines got me to Chicago safely at a fantastic price and for that I can't complain.,1
My wife and I flew from Istanbul to Abu Dhabi on flight TK 0868 on Thur 17 Oct 2013. It had been a great holiday but the flight out was a real let down. For inexplicable reasons our seats were in a hot zone in the plane and we felt like we were being subjected to some sort of in-flight sauna! We did ask the flight attendant (twice in fact) if she could let the flight engineer know of our discomfort. Nothing changed and our four hour flight was awful (not helped by the fact that my wife already felt under the weather). The staff member to whom we reported the fault appeared genuinely sympathetic but although the rear seats in the plane did get cooler we sweltered the whole trip. I think Turkey's a great place and would like to visit it again - but I will not travel on Turkish airlines again.,0
"No onboard entertainment unless you've downloaded their app (good luck finding that). Horrible seating I'm 5'4""' and my knees were jammed into the seat in front. I got massive leg swelling because there is no room to stretch your legs. Service is non-existent - you have to go to the back to even get water from the attendants. Food beyond awful. Lunch was a pasta with no sign of veggies a bread roll something that was supposed to be a potato salad with 1 olive on top and little sign of potato and a cookie. 4 carbs no fruit and no veg? This was advertised as a Lufthansa flight operated by Air Canada it wasn't a discount fare and we didn't know it was a Rouge flight until we boarded. Never again! Shame on you Air Canada! These flights were Lufthansa 6625 May 10 and Lufthansa 6624 May 24. Wonder if Lufthansa knows that AC is destroying its reputation with this dreadful service.",0
"This was my first time with Adria. Short hop from KBP to LJU. The airline is 3 star but my ticket had 5 star price tag. Online sale worked fine online check-in system issued me a pass with wrong boarding time (nearly 2 hours early). Luckily their call center worked well and I was told to report to the airport at normal time and use ""wrong"" boarding pass. It really worked. There were about 14 passengers onboard Canadair200. The plane was new and clean. Seats were very narrow however seat pitch was okay. My seat didn't work well so I did take off and landed in reclined position. Food was much below average (small cheese sandwich) bar service was good and generous. Flight departed late but made it in the air and landed about ontime. Crew were cheerful and attentive. My special meal was delivered and was okay (much better then standard sandwiches offered to other passengers). All in all a real strong 3 star experience but overpriced ticket. Also saw no difference between business and economy cabin. Same seats for different price.",1
Bangkok to London for myself and two children - 5/02/05 flight delayed 2 hours from Bangkok- no explanation given On boarding found no one at the entrance to plane so just wandered on and found our seats. Two of the three were broken and could not recline. A passenger behind us could not find her seat as shown on boarding pass. Eventually cabin crew discovered that the seat on aircraft did not exist and had to cross out a seat number using felt tip pen and write correct number up above. Overall impression of interior was very unpleasant and dim - hardly any light at all due to the very old aircraft used and no updating of interior. After taking off no hello from captain or any communication - it would have been courteous to know what the delay was . We never heard his voice throughout the flight. After arriving in Dubai the hour hour turned into 2hours 15 minutes- no cabin crew would tell me what the delay was for although I did see a Phuket Airlines engineer inspecting engines. Took off for final leg - at least this change of captain did mean that we heard his voice and he at least apologised for the 2 hour plus delay. I should mention that during the stop-over the engines were off and no aircon inside cabin which left most passengers very uncomfortable. Food was of low quality and beer i asked for was warm and not refrigerated. Crew were ok especially after seeing what they have to put up with. On arrival at Gatwick had to wait exactly 60 minutes for bags and with the extra delay of flight meant we missed our coach we had previously booked. Total flight time 18 hours (21 including arrival time at Bangkok - as we were told to arrive 3 hours before boarding?) After travelling for 20 years I can honestly say that this has been my worst experience ever and has put me off flying especially with children. I have to return to Thailand and would not fly Phuket Airlines if I was given free tickets - the whole experience from check in to arrival was most unpleasant.,0
Vueling from Heathrow-La Coruna. The plane was brand new. Sandwich and snack menu (to buy) pretty good for an airline. Check in and departure smooth and punctual landing a little early in both locations. Seats were comfortable only complaint the lack of legroom. Booked Vueling flights through Iberia's website. This is an all- inclusive price compared to the extras which are added on at vueling.com.,1
Flying for the second time this year with Cathay Pacific (Economy) and it's not as good as it used to be before. I was not able to reserve a seat online for my flight from MNL to AMS. I called the HQ in Manila and they advised me to come to the airport on time so I could reserve my seat (I wanted to upgrade to premium or business). Arriving at Manila International I found out that I was not able to upgrade in any way. From Manila to Hong Kong the flight was ok we had a new airplane and the seats were comfortable. Though we only got a cheap snack even though our flight was at 8pm and people were hungry. From Hong Kong to Amsterdam the flight was delayed and we had to move from Gate 69 to Gate 31. Finally we got to board our flight to Amsterdam only to find out that we were using an old airplane again. For some reason they use old airplanes to Amsterdam all the time lately. Same with routes from Hong Kong to Rome I was told by a stewardess. But flights from Hong Kong to Milan do have new airplanes. All in all super uncomfortable chairs and again I got back pain during the flight. Really the worst I have experienced with intercontinental flights. On another note: big difference in treatment between business and economy. I mean yes business class and first class do have the right to be treated a bit different since they paid for it. But I haven't experienced a nice service from the crew unlike I am used to when flying other airlines. It would be nice if Cathay can have a look at this. For now I will choose another airline next time going to my home country.,0
"Good flight both ways, checked in online using the mobile app which worked like a dream. Both flights slightly delayed due to ATC backlog but captain kept passengers informed. Found flight attendants to be both professional and courteous serving a good selection of snacks and drinks, also some good offers from the onboard shop. Plane on the return flight looked new and was comfortable.",1
"While they are in the air they are up to average expectations though seat belt checks and cabin baggage safety a bit casual. Flew Australia to Peru return and we called them ""late again"" lines though that could be airport ground staff problems. We had one of our flights cancelled with 10 days notice so had to stay an extra night in Lima and return late for meetings at home. Airline not interested in your extra cost and inconvenience despite our numerous representations. In summary safe enough but allow for delays and absence of customer service.",0
Booked Business Class BHX to DEL via IST. Business Class Service on the BHX to IST very hit and miss. Steward seemed nervous took my order for drink and forgot to bring me the drink. Later on during the flight the FA took my order for a drink and this one came. Flight attendant serving drinks without bringing them on a serving tray certainly shows me that the Turkish Airways staff need training and overall the service in business class was poor. The lounge at Istanbul is very good. Istanbul to Delhi boarding a shambles. No segregation between Business Class and Economy on boarding especially if you have to travel to the plane by bus. IST TO DEL - one of the most uncomfortable business class seats in the air. I travelled on 22/8/2014. I am going to travel in Business Class on the same route BHX to DEL VIA IST on October and I am hoping for better service. If there are no improvements I will go back to Qatar Airways or Oman Air from Heathrow.,0
Singapore-Jakarta-Singapore. Smooth check in flight was on time seats were okay. It was a short flight so it wasn't too bad. I thought it was a bit too hectic when they were selling food. Did not have a bad experience like I normally had when travelling with other budget airlines.,1
I checked in and arrived in good time at East Midlands airport on 10th July for a 19.50 flight to Glasgow. 45 minutes before departure the flight information notified that the flight had been cancelled. A protracted process followed whereby Glasgow passengers were transferred on to the Edinburgh flight which was delayed by over 2 hours. On arrival at Edinburgh we were transferred 40 miles by bus to Glasgow Airport. This would have been bad enough but I also had an interesting conversation with two East Midlands staff who told me that the airline had also pulled the Glasgow flight in similar circumstances on the previous 2 days. It seems that Flybe are cancelling flights on economic grounds but remain happy for passengers to turn up at airports in the full knowledge that their flights will not be operating. I also note with some interest that they have pulled the same stunt today with their morning Cardiff - Glasgow flight.,0
LUX-ZRH-ARN in C. The crews were smiling and calling me by name the food was outstandingly good and the business lounge in Zurich is a blast! They have the longest attended lounge bar in the world and are mixing great cocktails. This was the best business class experience I've had! (Even if all the European airlines sell economy class seats as business class.) Forget about Lufthansa.,1
HAN-DAD on an Airbus 320-200. New LCC-carrier in Indochina. Very busy afternoon got the last seat on plane as I purchased with very short notice. Service and interior colourful young talkative FAs. Check-in smooth and at a good visible location. Flight departure delayed 30 Minutes. There are many food and drink items and the prices are in general very reasonable even compared to Vietnamese prices. Due to a crowded Hanoi airport and due to its low priority for LCCs there was no direct gate boarding and the bus drive to the aircraft became cumbersome and tedious. The carrier resembles AirAsia though slightly less professional.,1
Liverpool to Dalaman. Cabin crew were pleasant and enough seat room. Plane was cleaner than previous flights with other budget airlines. No entertainment but going out was a night flight so just slept. Coming back piped music played throughout the flight. I would have no hesitation in recommending Onur Air.,1
"This airline is unpredictable and unreliable having worked in the hospitality service I am astonished with the lack of communication and lack of helpfulness the staff provided. Once arriving from an international flight that departed late because of Spirit the staff knew we were in the airport and did nothing to assist with getting on the flight even though it was clear that the flight left late and arrived late due to Spirit. The staff said quote ""Run"" when I asked for help in attempting to make my flight. Needless to say I will be arriving at my final destination with a bus 40 minute bus ride and another layover and no financial compensation for this disaster. The flight itself was uncomfortable had no provided entertainment no snack or beverage and if a consumer wanted to purchase food or beverage it was told that cash was not acceptable and only could take credit cards. The pilot announced decent early with another 25 minutes in the air exciting all passengers that needed to arrive on time to catch another flight. Spirit is not a comfortable or acceptable was to travel if you need to get where your going.",0
"Boarding the flight was on time, quick and efficient. The flight into Chicago was a few minutes early allowing me plenty of time to get to the gate for my connecting flight. Boarding the flight to Philadelphia was also on time, quick and efficient. This leg of my flight arrive 30 minutes ahead of schedule. My return flight from Philadelphia to New Orleans was a direct flight and arrived a few minutes ahead of schedule. I have never experienced any problems flying US Airways and can only hope that now that American Airlines operates all the flights, they will continue to excel in customer service.",1
Flew Air Canada Rouge Toronto to Cancun 4 hour flight that's about all you can take sitting in that little seat the seats are the most uncomfortable seats I have ever experienced if the seat in front of you reclines it feels even worse. The seats are small no inflight entertainment if want you can rent an Ipad which is pre loaded with movies the plane we were on was dated and old. One wash room was out of order. Drinks of water and pop served once during flight. Flight attendants are not very friendly you feel like your bothering them if your asking for a drink of water. Cash call for the airline and no consideration for the people who can only afford economy class tickets. I will never fly Rouge again.,0
"I decided to go with Spirit because of the price and didn't realize all the fees. You have to pay for everything, even water. The flight was late going out. We waited for our luggage for about an hour. On the return trip plane was late again. On arrival we sat at the terminal for half hour because their contractors to unload the plane were not there. Again we waited almost an hour for the luggage. ",0
Travelled to Montego Bay from Toronto. Flight delayed from the very start with no apology from airline officials in Toronto. On return from Jamaica flight again delayed for more than 4 hrs with no apology. I was travelling luckily with no children and all the officials would say is that they would update us as soon as they got additional information. The representative provided no apology just a $15 meal voucher. The inconvenience of it all resulted in a wait from 2pm to 8.30pm when the flight eventually left. The schedule arrival time in Toronto changed from 10pm to 2am. They did nothing inflight to compensate passengers.,0
My colleague and I booked our seats separately and asked if we could sit together (PD421 - Toronto to Montreal Jan 23). The young lady behind the counter in the lounge said the flight was full and we would have to ask customers on the plane ourselves. We asked twice and got the same answer. When we got on the plane it was half empty. Needless to say we sat together but were both surprised since Porter is known for their extra mile service. Sloppy was among our comments. Rethinking Air Canada if Porter gives the same attitude.,1
Flew Paris-Kuwait-Mumbai with a stop over in Rome. Boarding was quick and the flight was on time. The plane wasn't clean. There was dirt between the seats and the folding table had bread crumbs stuck to it! Stopover in Kuwait was okay. The airport has some restaurants etc although the prices are out of this world.,0
LHR-BOM-LHR return Boeing 777-300ER. Our seats were comfortable inflight entertainment was good with variety of games and Hindi and English movies. Check in at Heathrow was quick and at Mumbai airport. Tip - always check in online for both legs which saves a lot of time and ensure you don't exceed allowances. Food was good but once crew served the food and collected the rubbish after meals they disappeared and never came to serve and drinks or walk around on plane - nor attended to crew attention buttons when pressed.,1
"When we arrived at Beijing airport at 10:30 pm to check in for our flight to Paris we were told that the flight was delayed to 5:50 in the morning due to thunderstorm. I couldn't believe that as we had previously flown in much worse weather. It wasn't even raining but I won't argue with the decision Air China made as safety is a priority. We were already so tired and we weren't happy as our return flight to Korea with Air China had already been rescheduled inconveniently. It was very hard to access to the wifi at the airport so It was very difficult to change our pick up arrangements to accommodate the late arrival in Paris. I asked the Air China Duty manager at the check in desk to let us stay at the hourly hotel in the airport for a couple of hours as we were tired and a shower was needed considering the humid Beijing weather. I am very unhappy with how we were dealt with. One of the duty managers told us he understood how annoying the situation was for us. Furthermore, He said he would do anything he could for us so I requested the hourly hotel and he made a phone call. After he was on the phone for a short time he said, unfortunately, there were no rooms available . As much as we were frustrated and annoyed, I thought he couldn't really do anything more for us at that time. I asked him if he could put us on the waiting list for a room at least, so if any rooms became available we could get one. He said that wasn't a problem and he said our names were on the list. Although we were tired and frustrated we had no idea he was lying to us so we were quite polite and cooperative, I wish I grabbed his name at that time as we later discovered almost everything he told us was a lie. After we went through customs and security we headed to the hourly hotel as I wanted to double-check our names were actually on the waiting list. They informed us that there was no list as they had plenty of rooms available for us if we were willing to pay. We explained to the hotel attendant what we had been told and his response was that Air China said they were not willing to pay for it. With the help of the hotel attendant we tried to call the Air China Duty Manager but of course he wouldn't answer the phone. I also called the customer service desk of Air china and finally got through to somebody after several attempts and considerable time on hold. The lady told me that she couldn't help because I chose English therefore the line went through to LA Air China so that she couldn't help us. I don't know where to begin to complain about this situation. The way we were dealt with is totally unacceptable. First of all, how the manager lied to our faces like that I still can not believe he thinks he can do that to customers. I have never seen anyone so unprofessional and dishonest when representing a big company. If customer service is only for Chinese speaking people and English speakers only get a dummy speaker and they can't actually help anyone with the problems, they might as well be up front about it. Then they could have saved my time and money for making all the international calls like an idiot at 2am in the morning. I emailed the customer service. All I got was the number that I originally called in the first place! Ridiculous!",0
Amman to Doha via Bahrain. Both flights on time. There were 3 hot meal selections on the Amman to Bahrain sector. I chose an excellent and filling vegetable and rice dish. The crew were smiling and professional. Entertainment system has improved tremendously with a huge selection of movies TV shows games etc. Transit at Bahrain airport was a breeze. Bahrain airport is one of the best airports in the Gulf easy to navigate passenger-friendly good duty free and a good selection of food outlets. Service seems to have improved recently and I would fly them again without hesitation.,1
Mid July I flew from Frankfurt to Toronto. I had booked my flight in what they refer to as Comfort Class which would generally be in between economy plus and business class on major airlines. The flight was disappointing as they changed aircraft and the alternate plane was not equipped to offer Comfort Class. This was the second time this happened to me with Condor on the same route the year before. The negative rating is owed to the fact that the comfort provided did not match the comfort booked. Condor had chartered the plane from a British charter provider. The staff was very friendly. The food was adequate for economy class but inadequate for an elevated service class. Their customer service department is completely unresponsive.,0
"Very comfortable and direct flights. I was flying from Calgary to Kilimanjaro and return with KLM. Always enjoy the service. Several hour delay in Dar es Salaam though made for the return trip to be a little stressful. I would also say that the ""snack meal"" or second meal served should be improved the pizza stick was awful! on both flights! I would far sooner have fruits and veggies.",1
Although the trip was very long the staff and food was good my one bone of contention was how hard the seats were - they were so uncomfortable they made the flight from Taipei to London an endurance test rather than part of an enjoyable holiday experience.,0
Flight out was about 20 minutes delayed due to late arrival. Speedy Boarding ticket row 1. The boarding process was well organized - SB ticket holders first on bus and first off to enter aircraft at remote stand in Geneva. Aware that Easyjet have changed there hand luggage allowance but no passengers had their hand luggage checked or measured etc. Some taking on board alot more than allowed. A very quick food and beverage service for 45 minute flight. Flight attendants x4 working hard in short flight. No inflight entertainment as expected. Arrival in Nice to the gate safely.,1
Dubai to Kabul return. Very comfortable flight with edible food. Flight arrived early both directions. Aircraft are a little on the old side but clean and I assume well maintained. Will be happy to use them again. Great game of musical chairs before take-off. Seat numbers are in English and half the occupants being Afghans read Persian script. After looking round a little confused they have tendency to find free seat and sit down. Air crew resigned and allocate you another seat which of course has been originally allocated to another still boarding etc etc.,0
LH 419: I really enjoy traveling with Lufthansa for business I travel first or business class with my family we normally travel economy class. I really must say that I get the impression that economy is getting tighter with the years. The airlines offer much more space. Business and first I can recommend without hesitation.,1
Flight DL0056 Detroit to Heathrow: Passenger console did not work neither reading light nor audio/visual entertainment. For almost 7 hours I had nothing to do as I could not read or watch video. I asked for assistance but received no help or offer to move me to another seat.,0
"I was very disappointed by Virgin Australia's performance a few days ago. During the course of the afternoon many flights from Sydney were being canceled without any explanation being provided to customers. When I arrived at the airport in Sydney yet more flights (to Melbourne) were cancelled and my own flight disappeared from the departure board! There was no explanation for this or for the cancelations during the day. Or rather, talking to many frustrated passengers, it seems that Virgin had given no fewer than 5 different explanations ranging from 'bad weather' (not true as we checked most of the Australian cities), mechanical problems, change of equipment (but again no explanation provided), 'just don't know' (statement made by reservation staff to several passengers) and so on. We understand that problems occur at all airlines from time to time but the real test of a good airlines is its commitment to keep customers informed and on a regular basis, whenever problems arise. On this occasion, Virgin's performance was abysmally poor. My flight eventually left Sydney 45 minutes late. I was lucky as all around me at the Sydney airport dozens of irate passengers were being told that they wouldn't be able to fly until the next day. Again, no explanation.",0
KE 082 from JFK to Seoul was an Airbus A380 on December 6 inflight entertainment is limited. The food portions were small for Economy class. KE 653 from Seoul to Bangkok is on 777-300 again movie selection limited. Hope they can improve their inflight service and add more movie channels to their inflight entertainment system.,0
SHJ-CAI return flight. Dreadful airline. Sharjah hub airport is a mess. Ground staff is with the Cairo's one by far the rudest I have never met. There is a lounge I was supposed to get access in with my Star Alliance Gold card (as Star Alliance airlines as Egyptair currently operate flights from SHJ). Flight horrible no staff service at all and seats very cramped. Way back: same mess rude ground staff at Cairo old and tired A320 operated and nearly no staff service again with only a tiny and cold Edam sandwich served. Probably a fair airline for Africa but definitely not regarding world-wide standards. Never again.,0
ADD-GDQ-LLI-ADD on Bombardier Dash 8 one class service. All three flights were on time and full. Inedible sandwiches and the usual drinks were provided. Despite the lack of competition Ethiopian tries hard and does a good job.,1
Flew SATA from Boston to Lisbon and then back via the Azores. All flights were on time. Food was very good. Business class is an excellent deal - just a few hundred dollars for a bigger seat w/ foot rest departure lounge nice meal early boarding all the extra touches. Inflight staff were great - on the ground staff very helpful. A great trip.,1
It was my first time using Ryanair on a trip to London. I booked online and went into manage my booking to book a wheelchair at Dublin and Stansted. I printed both boarding passes and was glad to see wheelchair booked on both boarding card. At Dublin airport got the wheelchair all the way to the departure gate. At Stanstead there were 3 wheelchairs to collect passengers I was brought all the way through the airport and out to the bus stop for London. The cabin crew were friendly. On the return trip the process was the same in reverse.,1
DOH-COL-DOH Business Class. A mixed bag here flights out and back both on A340 -300 so had the lie flat beds which were good and allowed for a couple of hours sleep. Outbound flight Business cabin full and you could tell with the service being slow (1 hr for first drink) and orders forgotten. Food outbound ok. Return journey a huge difference Business not as busy but the service from start to finish was excellent and attentive with a great purser. Food much better as well. Both flights on time.,1
BKK-AMS-BRU / MRS-AMS-BKK. Long haul leg from BKK to AMS was fine. Paid the extra for a bulk-head seat so no complaints regarding legroom there. Plane appeared to be an early generation 777-200 as the cabin was looking a bit dated and seats a bit worn. Plane was clean though. Food was decent though nothing to rave about. Arrived in AMS and checked the board for my transfer to BRU and all appeared in order. I get to the gate just in time to find out my connecting flight got cancelled because the plane had no crew. KLM offered to bus the passengers on the flight to BRU but I made my own way. KLM provided the usual voucher and an apology. Return flight from MRS to BKK via AMS was fine. On the AMS-BKK leg I was on the same 777-200 but bought the premium economy for this leg hoping to be able to get some sleep. Seat I selected lacked legroom because the seat in front of me had the equipment box underneath it so I had to sit at an angle to stretch my legs. With the exception of getting off the plane first there is little point in buying premium economy. IFE system was seriously dated. Small screen with visual static (it was visible on all the other screens I saw). Hopefully KLM upgrades these when the plane goes through its next D-check. Overall experience wasn't bad but the European carriers need to step it up when the Gulf and Asian carriers offer a superior experience at the same relative cost.,0
Got to airport just to find out they had decided to cancel flight excuse given was flight was delayed for too long even though 2 more flights flew out after ours. Offered no accommodation and told refund would take 6 weeks this is the second time this has happened within a month on same route Gold coast to Sydney at 8pm.,0
TOM5678/5679 Luton-Las Palmas-Luton. Aircraft both ways was a 737-800 with the return aircraft being only a few months old. Outward flight left on time & the cabin crew were friendly and efficient. Flight deck crew both ways were fantastic and very informative about our flight and routing. PA was very loud which was great as I enjoy listening to updates from the flight deck. Legroom good on both sectors. Return flight 30 mins late departing but no fault of Thomson just volume of traffic at Las Palmas. Hot food purchased on board was nice and drinks services were frequent for a short haul flight. Overall very impressed with Thomson.,1
Copenhagen to London Gatwick Flight EZY5370 and EZY5365. November 1st - 4th. I will not fly with easyJet again. Sure it is very cheap but you don't actually get what you pay for you get much less. For a vacation it will make you stressed that you paid 50 euros in additional fees there and 50 euros in additional fees back. For a business trip it will make you uncomfortable for the rest of your journey abroad knowing that you had no space to breathe and sat in a poorly-maintained aircraft as transportation. It was my first time flying easyJet and definitely my last. Listen to the reviews above because these are true stories and I just experienced a common negative review above. EasyJet forced me to check my bag in for 50 euros one-way at the gate even though I have taken this bag every time I travel as a carry on. The surprise fees at the gate were more expensive than my ticket. Don't let the low prices online fool you.,0
I flew First Class from Palm Springs to San Francisco on July 7th. I have flown First Class on this route many times in the past with Alaska. In the past they had a great choice of salad or cheese plate on the flight with great service. Now they have totally eliminated that and didn't even bother to ask if anyone wanted a refill on their drink which they served with a cheap bag of pretzels. The flight attendant did everything possible not to walk in First Class but stayed in the galley doing nothing. Standards have gone down on Alaska.,0
Very pleasant experience. Would definitely fly with them again. I went out of Concord NC to St. Petersburg FL. I traveled with my cat. Unfortunately my cat screamed the entire flight (something that was I was not expecting). However the flight attendants were very understanding. The seats were comfortable. There was plenty of room under the seat for my pet carrier. I did not order any drinks. However the drink selections looked more than adequate and the prices were comparable to other airlines. This was a short flight (1 hour).,1
We were very impressed with the excellent service both going to Calgary and returning home to Victoria - both my husband and I needed some assistance in the terminals and were given very kind and courteous care at both terminals!,1
We flew direct from Vancouver to Paris and back. An excellent experience all around. Air Transat delivered great value for a very competitive fare. Flights departed on time and arrived early. Service was friendly professional and responsive. Cabins were clean and comfortable. We purchased the Option Plus package and would definitely do so again. The combination of seat selection priority check-in priority boarding extra weight allowance free drinks and snacks and comfort kit was worth the extra fee. We will certainly be travelling with Air Transat again soon.,1
My Wife and I flew with Norwegian to Lanzarote excellent check in and departure. On the return flight we were delighted to have a female pilot first time ever. The staff were brilliant we will definitely fly with them again. Would have been nicer if free Tea/Coffee were served as the beverages were rather expensive. But all in all a wonderful experience free WIFI is a definite crowd puller.,1
HEL-SIN Airbus A340-300. Flight on-time crew attentive and smiling! The first meal served was produced by LSG in Germany and was definitely better than average meals Finnair is serving. Warm breakfast not very tasty but definitely a must on a long-haul flights. IFE-system worked well but choice of movies is not very wide. Seats are comfortable but a leg rest would be very nice on long-haul flights.,1
I flew from Podgorica Montenegro to Belgrade and than Belgrade to Banja Luka. Even though they were ATR 72 airplanes (rather modest in size) I have to say that I had an extremely pleasant experience. Those ATRs looked very good renewed clean warm and pleasant. Flights were on time and according to the schedule staff were extremely polite and helpful. They looked (at least to me) new and with a lot of energy and enthusiasm. There was a meal served (these are 50 minutes flights i.e. rather short) with beverages and that was very refreshing. Excellent and I would recommend them.,1
"Chennai-Spore-Jakarta on 22 Apr. I have taken 8 flights on TR in the India-Spore-Indonesia sector and all were on time. Clean planes and pleasant crew. I have only two comments. I always select a first row seat and pay around $ 25 for it. Normally the middle seat will be vacant (no one wants to pay for a middle seat) which gives you some elbow room. However on 3 occasions when the flight was full passengers who had not paid the extra were given free access to to the front row making the paying passengers regret their decision. I have taken lot more flights in AirAsia also in the first row but I have not encountered this situation there. My second complaint is about the ""board me first"" privilege which is charged at $ 5. This is never enforced at Chennai Jakarta and Bandung. It is announced at Spore but on my last flight passengers were bussed to the plane and the boarding order was how one got off the bus. I will not be paying for this useless privilege in future.",1
I booked six Qatar Airways flights which were from London to Bahrain via Doha. In general I have no adverse comments to make about the economy service and the crew have always been pleasant. In fact the economy service is better with Qatar than a lot of other carriers. However it has been a nightmare on all but one flight with the air conditioning not working on the ground during boarding either in London Doha or Bahrain. As boarding takes a long time the temperature in the cabin reaches a very high temperature due to the confined space and the amount of people on board. Then the crew close the doors and still there is no air con switched on. We taxi out and now there is minimum air coming through but the air is hot not cold. When I have asked the cabin crew what is happening on these flights they always say the same thing - it is like this on all our flights and the cabin won't get cool until we have taken off. Such a shame because their economy service is good.,0
My recent (July 2014) flight from Johannesburg to Amsterdam on KLM was one of the worst flights. I had a terribly uncomfortable seat (15A) in what KLM ironically calls economy comfort class and for which it even charges a premium economy price. The slightly friendly cabin crew were among the least competent cabin staff I have ever seen on a flight. There were people still standing when the flight took off and no crew to be found. The crew tells passengers to close the overhead bins and finally the crew left the cabin lights on for several hours into into the flight and probably would have left them on the whole flight if I had not asked them to turn them off. The cramped seat made sleeping impossible the food was average to poor and served without salt pepper or utensils which I had to request separately. Departure was delayed the arrival late (although not too late) and nobody was on hand to provide connecting flight information. Definitely to be avoided.,0
Bristol to Palma on 22/08/13. Followed all of the baggage restrictions even paying the extra Â£60 to book my sons small bag into the hold and booked our seats. Flight staff on the way over were very difficult to understand. When we arrived in Palma on the return told we had to pay 60 euros each as we didn't have boarding passes. I had tried to check in online the day we flew and still there was no option to print any further boarding passes. She could see on her system that I had booked 7 seats and accessed the system but said at it was my fault and that it was an easy system. To add insult to injury I had a message on my home answer phone advising me I hadn't checked in this was left whilst I was still on holiday!,0
"SYD-PEK-TPE-PVG. A long queue formed 3.5 hours in advance (half an hour before check-in opens). This is a long flight, so arrive early to get a decent seat. The long haul offered two meals. Dinner was edible but breakfast was better. Drinks are free flow and crew are happy to serve water. IFE is channel-based (you don't get to choose the show on demand, rather what is being shown), and it may not interest those who don't know Chinese well. Did not hear the Captain speak for this long stretch, and crew's English announcements can be hard to hear. Flights to and from TPE: Breakfast appeared to be simpler. Captain did give announcement for this stretch. Wifi IFE is available for flights to and from TPE, but Air China specifically bars mobile phones from accessing this system. If you don't have a laptop, you are probably out of luck. Premium economy seats are empty, and are basically the same economy seats on SYD-PEK (channel-based IFE). ATC delayed 1.5 hours both directions. Overall a decent value for money, if you have China on your visit list and don't really mind about the IFE. Be aware of ATC delays if you only plan to transit.",1
Flights to Gran Canaria. If you book from the UK and select seats online they won't be there when you get to the airport and you will end up at the back of the plane as we did the connection in Madrid was horrendous and all our liquids including duty free was taken off us because we had to connect by bus in another terminal! The flight to Gran Canaria was good. The return was the same at check-in seats we had booked via the UK were not there we were offered rows at the back of the plane on the flight from Madrid to London the change at Madrid was the same horrendous with lots of furious passengers due to the heat no air conditioning in the transit lounge and very little time to catch the next flight. Planes on all occasions never used a gate once everyone was via bus so the flight time is good but the rest of it was bad. We had 75 minutes to make our connection after we touched down but we were so far away from the terminals by the time we arrived at the plane it was 10 minutes before take off and people were still getting on 15 minutes after we should have taken off - this happened both ways!,0
We flew from Shreveport LA to DFW. We then flew from Dallas to London. Neither plane left on time or got us there on time. We had people waiting in London. Same happened on the way back. On the way back we were shuttled to British Airways. Got to Dallas had a six hour layover. Because British Airways was late getting us to Dallas the layover was five hours. We sat in the airport in Dallas for 4.5 hours at the gate we were supposed to leave from. Twenty minutes before the plane was to leave from Dallas the gate was changed and we had to run to get to the new gate. I have come to the conclusion that American Airlines doesn't care at all about their customers. For the prices people are charged for tickets and fees you would think service would be better. Won't fly American again.,0
CPH-SFO-CPH in business. Outbound flight not very impressive. There was a foul smell in the cabin throughout the entire flight and it was filthy overall. Seemed like this particular plane had not been properly serviced in a while! IFE did not work but the purser cheerfully announced that in 2015 when SAS will have new plans this will be addressed. in my mind I have very little patience with technical glitches especially during a flight of more than 10 hours and even more so travelling in the front cabin. Food was good although I cannot understand that they have the same menu every time. Flying back was much much better. Plane in better condition nice and engaged staff and tastier food. Overall SAS has a decent business class product but the plans are getting old and the IFE system needs to be updated immediately.,1
"I just flew from Vancouver to LAX on a Rouge flight. I booked with Air Canada because of my aeroplan points collection and my general good experience with the airline. I'm 6'5"" so legroom on even a 3 hour flight is important to my level of comfort. All airlines are relatively tight but this Rouge flight was a new level of discomfort. I could barely squeeze my knees into the available area with one knee spilling into my neighbour's area. Even sitting bolt upright I wasn't able to get my knees into the available area. Thank goodness I was seated next to a tiny woman. To give you an idea of the lateral space she fell asleep and her head fell right onto my shoulder. When the person ahead of me put their seat back the seatback was right in my face to the point that I was barely able to read. It was ridiculous and I'll never fly Rouge again or AC for that matter as I might be bumped to Rouge without notice. On the upside the flight staff were very nice but that only goes so far when I'm crammed into a seat like a sardine.",0
Bangkok to Phuket with A320 in economy class. The lounge for economy class with free seats was comfortable. Service onboard very good they served a sandwich juice and coffee/tea. Crew smiling and helpful.,1
London to Brunei. A dry flight so no alcohol on board however you can take your own onboard to drink but when disembarking in Brunei it will be taken off you. I couldn't fault the service this was no difference to other airlines I had flown in business. The food was somewhat basic but still of good quality. The aircraft is an ex SIA 777 so the layout was old 3 rows of 2 seats the seat transforms into a comfortable bed duvets supplied. Brunei to Manila served 3 course meal which was better than the ones I had on the previous flight from London to Brunei. Business class seats on A320 which reclined to a very comfortable position. I could not fault the staff and service.,1
BOS-HKG via Philadelphia and Doha. When we arrived in Philadelphia we needed new boarding passes so went to the Qatar Airways counter for them. The attendant said that there was something wrong with our ticket boarding passes cannot be issued and only US Airways can fix the problem. She sent us to the US Airways counter without telling us what was the issue. We went over stood in line for 45 minutes waited for someone. Of course nothing was wrong. We went back to Qatar Airways for sure the issue had cleared and we were all set to board. We wasted over 90 minutes for no apparent reason. Philadelphia to Doha was delayed severely due to a bathroom issue. Doha Airport itself was small and messy with the new Hamad Airport opening 27 May it will probably get better. HKG-DOH with Cathay Pacific we were upgraded to Premium Economy free due to overbooking. The seat was very comfortable. The in flight entertainment system was more responsive compared to Qatar Airways. DOH-PHL I slept through most of the flight and my husband most of the flight. I don't recommend this airline unless you are flying business or first class where Qatar Airways actually value you.,0
From EMA to Alicante and return. Both flights on time. My first experience ofJet2 I was very impressed with how friendly all the crew were on both flights and the team at check in. The planes were extremely clean seating was great as there was more leg room in the standard seats than I am used to with other low cost airlines. The pilots gave an update during both flights which was nice and the crew did the cabin checks politely but thoroughly which I appreciated - with another airline I found on 2 flights the cabin crew rushed the checks and missed a few things. Landings were great both times really smooth no bump when touching down.,1
"Toilets were fine, seating was good. Food average (but at least there was food!). Great staff, pilots and overall a good experience. Some issues with our baggage as it appears our baggage never left New York (ORD to STL was a connecting flight from JFK). This issue was resolved quickly as our 4 pieces of luggage were delivered free to the place we were staying at in St Louis. Overall, our flight with American was fine.",1
BFS-EDI EDI-BFS July. Outbound flight slightly delayed due to a technical issue but no fault of the airline outbound flight was great! Attentive cabin crew A320 spacious and modern adequate legroom for this short flight ended up arriving early in EDI despite this short delay. Return flight on A319 was very much the same story! Will definitely use EZY again!,1
Auckland-Beijing-Guangzhou-Amsterdam return. Aircraft was very nice the cabin crew although with very limited English were polite and helpful the Ground support was atrocious as was the communication between CS and the passengers re: timing giving instructions and advising the delay of flights. We were delayed missed a connection were flying business class and ended up sleeping in a terminal in Amsterdam we had no idea the flight was late until we arrived at the next check in gate. Had left 1.5 hours between flights - not enough. On the return luckily we arrived at the airport 2 hours before departure it took 1 hr 45 mins to get the boarding passes. We were advised that we needed a VISA for Australia although were only transiting 45 mins in Melbourne. This took 1 hr 45mins to resolve.,0
I have travelled many times with this airline and have not had any problems. However I am disgusted with the way that the airline has handled the problem with the Volcano in Chile. I understand that flights need to be cancelled but Aerolineas is not communicating with its passengers and is also not making any attempts to help those trapped in Argentina due to flight cancellations. The staff were very rude even getting up and walking away. It is such a disappointment to see the way that passengers are being treated. Those of us trying to reschedule our flights are having problems getting through to the call centre. Very unprofessional.,0
NCL-TFS-NCL. Booked as part of a decent package deal for some last minute winter sun. We've often flown with Jet2 in the past and have often found them excellent and this was no exception. Their flights were very well timed so we weren't arriving into Tenerife at some god-awful time of night. The pre-flight add-ons weren't horrendously expensive and the website easy to navigate. We printed boarding passes at home which meant check in was a breeze. You can both outward and return well in advance but most passengers appear not to do this for reasons which are beyond me clearly preferring a lengthy check in queue rather than the (no queue) fast bag drop. Boarded and departed on time. Onboard warmly welcomed both directions by friendly experienced crew. The seats are not like sitting on a cloud but at 6ft tall they were fine even for me for 4.5 hrs. The additional god-send is the inability to recline which made the whole thing very bearable. We pre-booked hot food both ways which was very good and filled a gap. Bags waiting on carousel in Tenerife. Return much the same with zero queue at bag drop lovely staff and on time departure. The only slight snag was a 40 minute wait for bags in Newcastle. Overall Jet2 is a great company that is a clear example of company able to operate a low cost model while caring about its customers.,1
26th May CZ336 then CZ303. 7th July CZ304 then CZ335. China Southern was chosen for a good price in Business Class and the Dreamliner. We flew Auckland to China then on to the UK. We retraced our home flight to New Zealand so it was 4 legs taken. When we first boarded in Auckland no drinks allowed until in the air. (My wife requested vegetarian food on all legs of flight when booking the tickets). When the hostess asked for our meal choice during the flight my wife had no choices for her this happened several times on the 4 legs. Ok in the air now they ran out of beer and champagne after 1 hr explanation was only one bottle for business class so wife asked for a whisky and dry out comes a beer glass full of whisky and a small bottle of ginger ale. This happened on most of the flights and the movies forget it. Would we use them again never.,0
IND-BWI and BWI-IND. First trip was on a Boeing 737-700 aircraft. Seats a little worn but plane was clean. The flight was rather empty so had three seats to myself. The crew was okay prefer flight attendants to be dressed professionally rather than casual. The flight on the way back was full plane arrived on time in BWI and crew was much better this time round. Plane an older Boeing 737-500 I believe but it was clean and inviting. I got two drinks and a snack which was quite nice.,1
"My family and I had a Manila - Caticlan flight and it couldn't have gone any smoother. We were running late for our check in as there was a car accident on the way and we thought that we would miss our flight. Luckily as we arrived at the counter they were just putting the ""closed"" sign up and they put us through. One of our group member hadn't pre-purchased the baggage allowance so that took a few more minutes to put through. As we were on our way to the gate we heard our names being called and made a quick dash to the gate and again as we arrived the were just closing the gate and they quickly called the bus over to take us to the tarmac! We found them to be very helpful and accommodating. Would definitely travel with them again.",1
Gatwick - Valencia. When I arrived with my small suitcase and a small backpack with my laptop the assistant told me I could not enter with two bags. At the same time the other passengers came with one suitcase but with many objects (clothing bags) in hand. It was a robbery: Â£45 for a small bag. Never again will I fly with easyJet.,0
I have traveled Bangkok - London via Mumbai or Delhi several times with Jet with my 11 year old daughter or alone. Bangkok-Mumbai sector seems to be where they send their old planes with seats falling to bits. They often feel overcrowded due to Indian passengers bringing on those huge striped bags bulging with stuff which are about 4 times the 'carry-on' size and don't fit anywhere..but fortunately this is only a short flight. From Mumbai or Delhi to London the planes are always new and pretty well served by the crews. I've had exceptionally good service and pretty poor service on Jet. But the ticket prices are always very good value so I keep coming back. I find the food is generally OK identifiable and edible. And that's about all. The crew don't mind getting extra food and drinks in my experience. Seats are small cramped and uncomfortable for anything over 5 hours. I often wander to the back door area to get the blood in my legs running again and I have found the crew - with the exception of a few rude guys - understanding and obliging. Entertainment on Jet is as most people say not very entertaining. There are a few sitcoms and movies you've seen. I read my kindle and my daughter is locked into her laptop so this is not a problem for us.,1
Istanbul (Ataturk) to Cairo coach. The plane was modern and comfortable and relatively spacious. The meal was bad but edible. Dry airline so if you like a drink in-air plan accordingly. A fight of some sort broke out in the rear of the plane which flight attendants managed to resolve reasonably quickly. Departure wasn't too late and arrival was ahead of schedule.,0
I travelled with SK1605 from Stockholm Arlanda Airport to Zurich Airport on November 26. The aircraft on this service was a Boeing 737-700W and I travelled in SAS Plus on seat 4A. As always the cabin crew were very helpful polite and service-minded. The comfort of the seats were reasonably good and much better than the Slim Recaro seats found with many of the Star Alliance members on Intra-European routes. Since this aircraft was relatively new the cabin interior was nice and tidy. SAS Plus is marketed as Business Class but the level of service drink food and the general experience is drastically reduced compared to SAS previous Business Class. I was fortunate enough to have a free middle seat next to the other passenger which increased the comfort. The in-flight service is identical to SAS Go (previous Economy) but everything is included in the price when travelling with SAS Plus. The food consist of a choice between cold sandwiches or a salad served in a paper box and the drinks are for free. The quality of the food is acceptable but not what to expect when you travel in a class marketed as Business Class with ticket prices comparable to this class. I still hope that SAS will reintroduce the excellent Business Class the previously offered on Intra-European routes.,1
Domestic flight Casablanca - Dakhla and back. Flight times re-scheduled 1 hour later a few days before departure without any mail - or text notice. Food just terrible small dry white bread toasts. Will not fly with them again if I can avoid it!,0
LCY-BCN-LCY. on CE. I love LCY as you don't have to walk for miles. You come off the DLR down to the check in desk. Because we were flying Club Europe we were able to the use the dedicated check in desk so that was quick. Security was very quick and friendly. They seem to have even more security zones than my last trip. No lounges at LCY. Boarding was on time but no priority for CE pax or OW elites. However given as they board from the back and front of the plane it didn't mater. On board the 2 crew worked hard delivering the breakfast meals out to a full plane load. Nice product but the eggs were are bit crumbly. Arrived on time but bags took a while to come out with no priority. Return journey from BCN was good. Check in a breeze. Sala Miro lounge to wait in but being on the cusp of lunch there wasn't much in the way of fresh food about. Boarding was done by cabin/status. Not as full as before - 6 in CE only. Both meal options were salads ie fish or meat on rocket with some other little bits. Could have done with more leaves and some vegetables! Dessert was some cream concoction imitating an Eton mess. The crew were good and even offered their meal to a pax that didn't fancy the options. Bags at City came out in some order ie some priority bags then standard then a few more priority. Still a quick airport to exit. Shame BA is cancelling the LCY - BCN flights from August. I hope they bring them back.,1
London to Cape Town. Online check-in worked well no queues at bag drop lots of desks open and plenty of staff. Boarding well organised and departure on-time. Pristine cabin on new A330-200. Legroom was good even when the passenger in front reclined. Seats were quite firm although this was easily remedied with a couple of extra cushions. Warm welcome from Cabin Crew. Comfort bags handed out. Excellent bar service choice of 3 entrÃ©es for dinner which was excellent in quantity and quality. Hot Breakfast equally good. Large 10 inch personal TVs and a wide selection of movies and TV shows on demand. All-in-all an excellent flight.,1
Took two domestic flights on Air Bagan one from Yangon to Bagan and another Mandalay to Yangon. Both flights were with ATR-72 aircraft. The interior of this aircraft was very cramped with hardly any leg space. The aircraft definitely showed its old age. The flight from Mandalay to Yangon was free seated and flight was completely full. The in-flight service was nice and they served savoury croissants and cakes with drinks. Regarding reservations the booking system is fairly tricky. Also the airline requires the passenger to confirm the flights at least 24 hours before departures. Yet the 4 phone lines are constantly busy. For both flights our hotels repeatedly tried calling to no avail. Air Bagan offers value for money because there is hardly any competitive alternative today.,0
"Avoid at all costs! It is worth it to go through LHR EWR MAD etc. I have used this airline 3 times and each time I have been delayed over 12 hrs! Customer Service is non-existent. I was supposed to fly out this evening and received a call that it has been cancelled until tomorrow at 8 am. We will arrive LIS at 7pm and there will be no trains available to my final destination until the morning. They will not provide hotel car taxi as ""LIS is the final destination"". If I purchase a ticket it is essentially a contract. I purchased a ticket so I could get there in the morning. By cancelling the flight and rescheduling 12 hrs later is a breach of that contract and they should reimburse me! The cheaper fare is not worth the hassle and stress they give you.",0
DCA-SFO-DCA. One of the better cross-country flights that I've taken and added bonus of being non-stop. Boarding is a bit weird-front to back but airplane was new and clean. Young flight attendants were pleasant and a nice change from the surly FAs of the legacy carriers. Direct TV and audio free but movies headphones are extra. I'm a petite person(5 ft) and leg room and leather seat were roomy enough. Yes there is no free snacks but I brought food with me and ordered free drinks from the TV menu. All in all Virgin America is a great cross country airlines and I would fly with them again.,1
"Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City in July 13 2013. Problem started with check-in. Upon check-in there was only one staff member at the counter and there was a long line of at least 50-60 people. It took more than 40 minutes to check in one bag that was already pre-paid. After I checked in and had my bag tagged I was called back. The counter crew member told me I needed to pay extra because I appeared to have too many bags. The boarding process was horrible. No order at all. People with babies and infants did not get to board first. Not an efficient boarding process at all. Flight scheduled to depart at 3.05 pm still on the shuttle at 3.07 pm. Finally took off at 3.31 pm. I choose a ""premium"" type of seating to find out that I was randomly assigned a seat. Why do I have to pay extra to sit in a ""premium"" seat when JetStar doesn't honor that. The worst part - no smile from any crew. Overall horrible experience.",0
BLI to HNL on 26 December 2012. Alaska's in-flight staff were excellent on this flight. Three beverage services and free mai tai's before landing. The rented Digiplayer was delivered promptly after take-off. Staff were all very cheerful and did their best to make our flight enjoyable. Excellent work.,1
Flew on a B767-300 Short Haul. The food drink and service was substantially better than Economy with Air NZ which was excellent as I would rate Air NZ economy service highly. Great selection of modern movies and shows with IFE. The seat while dated was sufficiently comfortable for my 6'3 build. However people who have a slightly larger girth may struggle with the seat. Moving past another passenger from the window seat was also a tricky situation. However overall a very pleasant experience would certainly recommend.,1
Paid Â£190 for a return flight Cardiff - Edinburgh. 29/06 - Cardiff to Edinburgh flight delayed over an hour. 01/07 - Edinburgh to Cardiff delayed over two hours. Kept waiting between gate and plane then again when on plane. Staff arrived after 10 minutes with packs of canned fizzy drinks a pretty trivial reason for keeping a bunch of tired passengers hanging around! Both delays blamed on late arrival of plane from Jersey.,0
SYD-CDG return. I have travelled to Europe several times and never look forward to it. Booking and check-in no problem staff and service was very good. The addition of a TGV ticket to get me closer to my destination was much appreciated and connection was easy. My only quibble was a limited entertainment selection.,1
I flew a few days ago back from Ercan airport in Cyprus. I found the flight to be quite smooth until we reached London when we hit a bad spot of turbulence. The crew were quite helpful in helping some of those suffering from anxiety. As a nervous flyer myself I appreciated this. The leg room was a bit of a let down especially for those like my husband who complained of feeling a bit cramped. We ordered some food on the plane and I was pleasantly surprised. The airplane was very clean when I boarded and I wad greeted with smiles from the cabin crew. I found the captain very informative. Overall I found my experience to be quite enjoyable even though the planes were quite small.,1
Another round trip from CNX to KUL. Once you know how to 'play' low cost airlines they do offer good value for money (but not always). The LCCT is getting a bit long in the tooth for the number of pax passing through but BKK immigration staff would do well to see how to handle pax properly and efficiently. I prepaid for a meal and found it to be very tasty indeed. Although they claim to have a no outside food policy onboard they don't implement this. Biggest problem with low cost carriers is the pax they carry. FA's need to be more strict (politely of course) with pax who get ready to get off long before the aircraft reaches the gate.,1
GIG-CDG-LIS AF443 Rio de Janeiro to Lisbon via Paris Charles de Gaulle Boeing 777-300ER brand new aircraft friendly cabin crew very poor seat comfort for an 11 hour overnight transatlantic flight. Just 2 meals during the flight after 2 hours all the crew disappear to go and have a rest on the back of the plane as you see them 3 hours prior to landing waking up and tidy up themselves. They just give you a poor amount of juices and no food at all just ice creams. IFE very good and a good selection of movies as the screen is big enough. Very poor seat comfort in economy you hardly can pull down your chair. Overall is a good value for price flying with Air France don't expect something excellent. They should look after the standards followed by KLM as they are in a partnership which is an excellent choice for a long haul flights!,1
I travel across the country every week (4 trips a month on Continental). As a result I am a Platinum member. Before the United/Continental merger being Elite status was beneficial due to my upgrades to first class. However now that the merger has begun I am no longer upgraded. I am trying to figure out why it is beneficial to be Platinum/Elite on Continental these days. Very few perks - so I am considering starting to build my mileage on a different airline since being a Platinum is irrelevant to Continental since the United/CO merger. On my last trip I sat in the exit row (oh yea that's a perk-I don't have to pay to be available to save lives in the event of an emergency) with 2 other Platinum members - all of us have decided there is no longer a need to have an allegiance to Continental - no upgrades and no real perks to speak of for the allegiance of spending our money to fly this airline. I have experienced United airlines and Continental patrons are in for a very rough go of i. This complete disregard for upgrading Platinum members is just the beginning. When I was Silver and Gold I was upgraded close to 100% of the time - no longer! The United/Continental merger is a disaster for Continental passengers who enjoyed the perks and usually passable service to its elite members.,0
Just had a return trip LGW-BKK out via Hanoi return via HCMC. Outward flight was approx 1 hour late from LGW within an hour of the flight we had been given the food! Menu for the opposite direction and I had sussed out my in flight entertainment didn't work when meals were served I was asked what I wanted from the menu! I told them and they didn't have it the correct menu was taped to the trolley. In Hanoi I had a 3 hour connection you can't change money 'airside' in Vietnam meaning I couldn't eat or drink. Return journey connection was also 3 hours in HCMC but was actually 11.5 hours we were put up in a hotel but it took almost 3 hours for Vietnam airlines to organise it. When we eventually got going there was no apology from cabin crew or captain of plane and arrived LGW 15.20 instead of 06.45 on Dec 1st.,0
20/12/2013 - Business Class flight (TP11) from LIS to REC. The worst business class flight experienced in my life. Priority boarding done with other classes. No matter if you are biz or gold member. All classes were boarded at the same time. IFE system very poor. Only 5 video channel and an outdated music channel list. Food: very poor in quality and quantity. I discovered that they serve the same food also on the economy class. In this case chicken and rice pudding were the same. The only difference was on the choice (4 options) for the main course and on the plate (plastic in ECO and ceramic in BIZ). Staff: impolite and unfriendly. Seat comfort: no flat bed but acceptable. Landing in REC on time.,0
My wife and I were scheduled to go to Los Angeles to visit our family today. Arrived at Frontier in Bismarck ND an hour before the flight (at 5.30am). Bismarck is a tiny airport and the last time I attempted to get there 2 hours prior to departure no one was there. When we arrived there was a large line at Frontier we waited for 20+ minutes and the lady at the check in stated that Denver (Frontier's hub) had shut down their computers and nobody else would be able to check in. The entire line missed their flight. This was due to the fact they opened the check in line later than they should have. They did not shut down the check in line 45 mins prior to the flight departing because they were trying to catch up from a combination of opening up so late and the incredibly slow service. Not only were there no other flights that day the flight for the next day was full and we were told Saturday was the first option. You would also think this would be at no additional charge you would be wrong to think that as well. They charge you transfer fees third party booking fees difference in the cost of the new ticket etc... So all in all we initially paid $635 for the tickets for the two of us then I paid $679 to put my wife on a Delta flight same day to get her to LA lastly I paid $399 for myself to fly from Dickinson to LA on Friday morning. Frontier gave me a credit for the flight I missed that ended up being worth $33. That doesn't even cover the gas for me to drive back from Bismarck after they caused me to miss my flight.,0
Flew from LDN Luton to Iasi return. 737 plane and was only half full. The plane itself was old and showing it's age but comfortable leg room. Really impressed with service of Tarom. Great crew who were attentive and polite. Flight only 2hrs 50 mins and was very smooth. Food was good and nice offering of wine and beer included. One let down was the lack of in-flight entertainment of any kind. Even the map (my favourite) didn't work on flight back.,1
ORD_DUS-FLR on AA/Air Berlin - 11/27 DUS-ORD on 12/8. Biz class full in both directions - I hope that continues as flying through DUS is a breeze compared to connecting at Heathrow. ORD-DUS 767-300 - the flight attendant was the only let-down: she was friendly but wasn't too attentive and talked with other passengers about how she didn't like flying long haul and was at her tolerance limit after a 7-hour flight. If you don't like long-haul then don't work it - ridiculous. Food was good - I pre-ordered it online and that worked well. Purser was very friendly. Arrived 45 min ahead of schedule and did the easy connection to Air Berlin Q-400 to Florence. Nice flight and on-time. DUS-ORD 767-300. Great flight attendant - friendly and attentive without being too in-your- face. Good food pre-ordered again online. Samsung Tablet is nice but again they don't put enough TV shows on it - you get one episode from the 1st season of a series. Overall I hope with the merger things keep getting better with FA attitudes. Good flights in general.,1
Flew the JFK-CAI-JFK and thought it was fantastic. flight was on time. 2 hot meals and a pre-arrival snack drinks available the whole flight. The entertainment system was quite nice but needs to be updated.,1
MAN-LHR-WAW booked via Star Alliance partner LOT domestic legs with bmi. bmi cancelled the outgoing domestic flight twice without informing me of the changes LOT informed me of the second change. I eventually flew to LHR with BA as I couldn't risk missing my flight to WAW. Well over an hour was spent on phone to the bmi call centre who were very obstructive at times and kept telling me to phone LOT. Changes were eventually made through bmi. Return flight to MAN was fine - a comfortable Embraer 145 with the usual excellent onboard crew.,1
Flown on TZ2 SIN-SYD and TZ1 SYD-SIN recently on FlyBag ticket. Scoot's website is user friendly. Check-in at Singapore's Changi Airport and Sydney's Kingsford Smith airport was fast friendly and efficient. On board planes 9V-OTE and 9V-OTA looked well maintained. The interior was clean and had a fresh look. Seats are not too uncomfortable with good legroom. However the light and call attendant buttons were too easily triggered by passengers shifting about in their seats. Pleasantly surprised that the cabin staff regularly ensure that the toilets are cleaned and freshened. They seem to put a lot of effort into it which I greatly appreciate as an almost full load both ways result in heavy toilet usage. Captain and first officer spoke very clearly when making announcements something I seldom experienced when travelling with other airlines even full-service ones. Food however is not fantastic and leaves much to be desired. Overall a good experience with Scoot and may consider flying with them again.,1
SXM-EIS-SKB-ANU-DOM-BGI-SLU-SVD-POS - I left a bad comment some years ago about this airline but they seem to have improved. 90 per cent of my flights left on time the luggage with me in (they are famous for losing bags). Cabin crew friendly but service is nonexistent even on 1 hour flights. Some of the planes are very old and smelly tickets are pricey but if you buy them in the package it is cheaper - but be aware that you can not change.,1
Not sure if it is a charter or schedule airline. Travelled Geneva-Heraklion return. Excellent both ways friendly staff a nice lunch on way out questionable on return. As a matter of personal conscious I do not eat Veal however a bite of the sausage on return leg made me question it's ingredients to find it was veal. They should have informed pax prior to service so we had a choice to refuse. Other than that pretty faultless flights.,1
JFK-CAI-JNB-CAI-JFK. First 3 legs were comfortable lie back seats are a treat food was plentiful and palatable and as long as one gets a bottle of water at the beginning of the flight the absence of cabin service isn't a problem. Inflight entertainment doesn't offer a lot of choice but the screens are large. However there seems to be a blatant disregard for health and safety. On the last leg there was a large family with 5 badly behaved kids disturbing other passengers and interfering with cabin service throughout the entire trip. It's a wonder there wasn't a hot beverage incident. One child was still running around while the flight was landing on the tarmac! It was one of the worst inflight experiences I have had and the reason I have rated trip satisfaction as fair only.,1
B747 ICN to AKL Economy cabin is a 3-4-3 layout. Boarding somewhat chaotic at Incheon as flight was very full. Cabin looked a little bit drab and tired when compared to B777-300. Seats not quite as good as newer economy on newer planes in the Korean Fleet. Legroom was excellent. Inflight entertainment was extensive. Where Korean excel is the service received from the cabin crew very efficient and smiling steward was very pleased when I asked to try Korean Beer and provided extra snacks to accompany the beverage. Overall the experience was very good Western airlines should take a real good look at themselves Korean Air will be getting my business again.,1
Orlando for business - trip generally fine - my complaint specifically regards handling of baggage policies and staff lack of freedom to solve lost baggage problems - checked 1 piece of luggage 28 minutes before the flight 2 mins too late - it was not loaded on my flight - didn't find out until arrival and going to baggage service - told it would be on next flight 1 am - but JetBlue staff hands are tied. Customer has to return to the Airport to pick up their luggage or make arrangements on their own to have it shipped - JetBlue baggage service called 7am to tell me to pick up my luggage - finally agreed to send with 3rd party service for cash fee $30 - It arrived after 4 pm so I attended my business meetings in dirty travel clothing - JetBlue has got to figure out a better way - I would rather pay upfront for luggage service than get free and no respect.,0
Flew from Glasgow to Dalaman on Monday 15th Sept returning 22nd Sept. Both flights on time no complaints there. One of the female air stewardesses on the outgoing flight was a bit unfriendly very serious looking - no smiles but it wouldn't put me off flying with them again.,1
I had two flights with them- London Florence and Naples- Olbia (Sardinia). Both were delayed 24 hours. At least with the first one we were in the UK and our rights were upheld. But for the Italian flights they treated us very badly pretending not to understand us even though an Italian passenger translated for us. As we found out later they breached regulations by not providing accommodation or a phone call even though at the time we did ask the supervisor. We were left stranded in Olbia at 2 am and ended up being ripped off by a taxi driver to the tune of ??00. Between the two flights we lost two days of hotel bookings one day's car rental ran up a large mobile phone bill trying to sort it out with Meridiana etc. As an earlier poster described their offices are incredibly inefficient when you have a complaint. Some staff hang up if you speak English and none of them seem to know the right number for customer services. One spoiled holiday nine months six letters innumerable long distance calls and only a partial refund!,0
Just back from return trip to Dubai. It was everything we hoped it would be. From the moment we stepped through the door at the Silverjet Lounge in Luton to arriving in Dubai it was smiles and excellent service from all the staff. It was the same on the return trip. On the outward flight with the window blinds closed it was hard to believe that we were actually on a plane. The food and drink served on board were excellent. We shall certainly use Silverjet again to return to Dubai.,1
Dreamliner LGW-GOA in premium cabin. Definitely not worth the extra Â£900 priority boarding at Gatwick and priority luggage off on return to Gatwick was good. Service out to Goa was good lovely food lots of drinks services tea coffee etc. nice crew out (Gatwick based) return journey crew were miserable (except for a good lady in premium) food was awful and inedible. Ran out of various drinks. Hardly any cabin services (and I didn't want alcohol just water and tea etc. Sat in two seats together each way. Fine until the seats in front recline and the person by the window has to climb over the person next to them. Poor designed windows which even on darkest setting let the blinding sun through. Lots of the chairs look shabby already and the arm rests sunk in when you leant on them. two toilets in cabin but the economy pax kept coming in to use them. On the good side go in economy in the extra leg room seats. Felt no jet lag either way. We hit fast head winds and a jet stream on the return journey but the turbulence was definitely diminished by the plane. A beautiful plane but was a bit disappointed I think the crew on the return journey really let it down.,0
Flew from Gatwick to Antalya on 10th October. Flight due to leave at 9.30am - was delayed till 4.30pm. Reason given for delay was a technical issue with the plane. A painful 9 hours in Gatwick for all passengers - given that most would have arrived at 7.30am for check in. Food vouchers were given out - if you happened to hear about it. Returning after a good holiday on October 17th we experience another set of delays. The 5.15pm flight from Antlaya did not leave until 10.30pm. The reason for delay was the incoming flight was struck by lightning during a torrential storm and had to be diverted to another airport for landing - before coming back to Antalya. So I was OK with this - and happy to be finally on my way. Only for the announcement on the plane that we were going to have a stop in Vienna ! - to pick up a replacement set of cabin crew - as the existing crew would have worked over their hours and could not per regulations fly with us to London. Thomas Cook lost all credibility here by not telling us this info before we boarded the plane (so passengers had a chance to advise anyone meeting them at Gatwick of the change in arrival time) - and also they lied to passengers by saying we would only be on the ground at Vienna for 5 minutes as the replacement crew would be waiting for us. This was not the case - we were on the ground at Vienna for 1hr 20 minutes (in the plane) waiting for the replacement crew to arrive from London. Finally we get underway with another painful 2 hours at Gatwick - arriving at 3.45am - much later than our scheduled 7.50pm arrival. Thomas Cook lose all credibility by their dishonesty and lack of clear information on flight delays. Just be upfront and give the facts when you know them - don't dress things up to save face. I also question the large number of flight delays they have - as evidenced by the comments of other passengers. Why does this airline have so many technical issues with their aircraft? It means if you book with Thomas Cook you have to factor in long delays to your trip. Otherwise book elsewhere.,0
My husband and I just deplaned from the Toronto - Barcelona flight. Having read the mounting negative commentary on Rouge over the last few months we were prepared for the worse. We were pleasantly surprised. The 767-300 was clean and maintained the bathroom likewise the attendants all friendly and personable. We were in premium and there was a big blanket and pillow and a small bag of toiletries plus bottled water at our seats. Food was most satisfactory (same as AC as I had most of it earlier in the day). No complaints and such a relief to have gone Rouge. Plugs below the seats for the electronics. Premium rouge will never be business class - still rather cramped but I would fly it again and we will on our return home! The inflight entertainment was easy to hook up to with my iPad and mac air but it kept disconnecting necessitating 9 more clicks at least 10 times thru the flight to get the program back that I was watching.,1
"This is a comment about the ""new"" American Airlines (American/USAir). My wife daughter and 15 month grandson flew USAir Express from Washington National to Louisville yesterday for a special occasion. They took off more than 2 hours late because of a broken toilet on the commuter airline (USAir Express). Today they were scheduled to fly back on American Eagle from Lousville to Washington National on a 1.25pm flight. First flight was delayed until 3.30pm and now cancelled with no alternative until tomorrow. So now they are driving back. We will do everything in our power to avoid flying the ""new"" American.",0
Central Asian carrier on which I flew five segments in November 2006. Beijing (PEK) to Ashgabat (ASB) and back a one-way flight from Mary (MYP) to Ashgabat and a round-trip between Ashgabat and the northern town of Dashoguz (TAZ). All flights were on Boeings with 757s on the international legs and 717s domestically. The pilots were allegedly Western-trained and looked Russian but none said a word during my five flights. The planes weren't bad. The seats were maintained and the cabins were clean. There were other signs that this wasn't the Delta Shuttle. The bulkhead wall at the front of each cabin bore a framed photograph of the President For Life. Many passengers paid no heed to any rules about seatbelts or cabin movement. Boarding the plane was all pushing and shoving and the old ladies had the best moves. Aside from a flight map on the 757s there was no in-flight entertainment. The food was standard airline grub and flight attendants were reasonably diligent if unenthusiastic about serving drinks and responding to the call button which the passengers pushed without hesitation. There was no in-flight magazine. Luggage limits were nonexistent but in a country where almost everything has to be imported I was sympathetic. The space on my flight was so oversubscribed that three trucks of baggage were left behind. The stranded bags were to arrive on the next flight with room. Turkmenistan Airlines has no web site. It has no frequent flyer program that I could discern and is not part of any alliance. It serves the major cities in Turkmenistan in the sense that it connects them to Ashgabat. The foreign destinations include London Beijing Moscow Bangkok and Istanbul. Flights through Ashgabat are cheap; flights to Ashgabat are expensive. Turkmenistan Airlines is cut- rate transportation which isn't so bad if your expectations are low.,0
JFK-IAD ERJ-195 The seat is nice and provides enough legroom. It was a short flight of about 50 minutes. There were personal TV which is good enough for a short flight. You can switch channels to news such as CNN. The flight has snacks and cola for complimentary. It is the best experience I have had on short flight.,1
"We travel by AA to New York every Christmas and always enjoy the journey. We travel economy class therefore no frills nevertheless it's good value the staff are kind and the food and drinks are perfectly acceptable. This year our return journey was postponed due to illness and I would like to say a huge ""thank you"" to AA for their efforts to get us back to the UK. Assistance was arranged at JFK and LHR without which we could not have managed. Excellent service and greatly appreciated.",1
ARN-TXL-ARN in April in SAS plus. B737-800 of somewhat ageing model but still well kept. SAS plus is a mix between business and premium economy within European and domestic routes and works fine. As a SAS and star Alliance gold member offered seat block. Breakfast on first leg was good as was lunch on second leg back. Free drinks and snacks on that is a nice touch. FA's polite and smiling which is always nice. Flight back no priority boarding but by bus to gate which feels very low cost especially flying in premium cabin. Flights on time.,1
"Prestige class from Seoul-New York return. They had some of the worst business class seats I have ever sat in. The airline calls the seats ""lie-flat"" and should not be allowed to. When fully reclined into a bed the seats pitch downward at a noticeable angle causing you to slide right down them. I got no sleep on a long haul flight because of them. Will never fly this airline again for business class.",0
"Surprisingly decent flights from YWG-YYC-OGG. Flights on time from YWG delayed slightly from YYC-OGG. Air Canada 767-300er (non rouge) is a solid air craft. Surprised however that the crew did not offer a free meal on a 7 hour international flight. Passengers we're restless about that. Decent pitch for a guy who is 6""4 such as myself. The better of the two AVOD systems in Canada for sure. Only gripe was an extended period of ""turbulence"" where there was no communication many passengers stood up to use the facilities as did I. About 3-4 hours into the flight. The senior flight attendant rudely remarked ""you know the seatbelt sign is on!"" Not exactly highly service oriented. But still worth the trip from Calgary. This route for sure will be a rouge flight soon in which case avoid like the plague. But for standard AC mainline about as expected nothing wrong but a few things missing. Far superior to United service to Maui for example through Denver.",1
We had a terrible experience with how our cancelled flight was handled and the subsequent customer service after the flight on June 22nd out of New York (JFK) to Shannon. After returned to JFK due to problems with the plane's mechanics we were on the tarmac for 3.5 hours and then it took another 3 hours before we arrived at a hotel to spend the night. The next day we returned to the airport and there were only 2 ticket agents to re-ticket almost 400 passengers. We were given vouchers to use on the plane which we could not use once we got on the plane! We missed our reservation in Shannon and Aer Lingus would not refund this amount. The customer service at the New York Office was just an ineffective as the services we received in the airport.,0
Flew September 17 2014 JFK to Orly. We left 10 minutes early and arrived almost an hour early. We flew premium economy and it was great. The flight crew were kind and attentive. Our return flight was cancelled several days prior to departure and that's when it went from great to not so. We were provided alternate flights but it was terrible having to connect in Heathrow and only have 40 minutes to get through customs and security it was a sprint to make our flight to JFK. In the end I would say we had a positive experience and would recommend Open Skies.,1
Hong Kong - BKK TG 639 Business class. Lovely flight. The upgraded cabins are warm welcoming and modern. The Thai staff were attentive and efficient. Welcome drinks were offered including a second round and service was efficient. Because of the flight time (dinner time) and the relatively poor selection of food in the lounge at HKK the meal service has room for improvement. Thai has the best flight times between HKK and BKK and you can consistently snag an a decent price in the royal silk cabin without too much pre planning. Wouldn't hesitate to fly THAI on this route in the future. Have never failed on service in my experience.,1
AMS-BKK. Seating 3x4x2 flight 90% Full. The one big problem was that the meals were only just warm not hot as they should have been. Crew carried out their duties well. Would fly them again.,1
Flew VCE-DOH-CMB and TBS-GYD-DOH-ORD. Friendly and extremely helpful crew great entertainment and affordable price. I've flown them four times already and would recommend.,1
LHR-SNN return. Good flights and service. Fairly no-frills but you don't need that much on a short flight. At least you have an assigned seat. Would always use Aer Lingus in preference to Ryanair.,1
Service was excellent additional extras for overnight comfort were appreciated. Flew Incheon to HCMC return both trips were excellent. I asked to change my seat to something closer to the exit and it was arranged immediately and with a smile. Mealwise - the meal was better than average. Entertainment options and customer service made Korean Air stand out.,1
LHR to DUX return. Very full overnight flight going daytime return. Both legs much better than expected. The cabin staff were well turned out cheerful helpful and efficient. Food very good for economy and even though I was at the back of the plane all choices were still available. Wide range of entertainment. Would happily fly with this carrier again.,1
We flew with Air Canada Rouge April 24th and May 1st 2015. We travelled from Toronto to Curacao (return trip). Both flights were excellent and smooth. Best landing I have ever experienced! Flight crew were very professional and helpful to all peoples' needs. I strongly recommend and will fly with this airline again.,1
"Miami to Rome via Lisbon in June 2015 and Venice to Miami via Lisbon in July 2015. TAP did a fantastic job on all legs of our journey. The food was great, flight crew was respectful and competent. The aircraft was clean,  flights were on time. And it is was the least expensive flight available.",1
"We travelled to New Zealand and back on Virgin. On the way over the cabin was too cold and when I requested for a blanket the cabin crew said it was only for Premium economy passengers. The way back was even worse. The flight was combined with Air New Zealand passengers who get meals on board so we had to wait for 1.5 hrs until the trolley came to the aft of the aircraft to our seat when I requested a glass of water the crew were rude saying ""everyone is waiting"" and refused to give water to my son saying he has to wait. I want to give zero star to all the areas but unfortunately the system is accepting a minimum of 1 star. No star for service and attitude.",0
Bangkok (Don Mueang) - Hat Yai return with Thai Lion Air. A mix experience from pleasant to fair enough. Booking system and online check - in fine their website is easy. Staff very friendly polite and professional. Aircraft is brand new 737-900er with Sky interior look nice and exit row are comfortable. On the return flight my preferred seat request is refused despite it being available regular seat are tight cramp and very uncomfortable. Hot meal sold on board had run out  only instant noodle or snack available. Crew are apologetic with the problem and tried to accommodate other request. Punctuality is perfect. Expense wise their fare are cheap and include all those miscellaneous cost (eg. tax and VAT) 15kgs load luggage free. Will not hesitate to fly them again at this cost and level of service.,1
"A combination of hit and miss but as its my first ""experience"" on a US airline and using the 3 major American legacy carriers Delta seems to have offered the most consistent service level even definitely seriously sub par compared to Asian and European carriers. Flew from Bangkok to Los Angeles through Tokyo Narita. Delta's service in Thailand and Japan far superior than on US soil. BKK-NRT with a B747 the seats were extremely thin. Cannot conceive sitting in such a seat all the way to LAX. From Tokyo Narita a comfortable B777. Flights on time entertainment acceptable with an OK selection of films. Food edible however spartan portions. Flew Delta Connection from Los Angeles to San Francisco with a very comfortable Embraer jet. Not happy about paying for checked in luggage. No other service on board. The return flight was a disappointment. Delta sold me a return routing from Los Angeles to Tokyo Haneda and then 19 hours later from Tokyo Narita to Bangkok which I accepted assuming that the airline will assist in the transfer and accommodation. Delta refused to assist in any of the above thus I had to handle my own transfer between the airports as well for own accommodation and food. This is the main reason why I will be adamant in flying to the USA with a non local airline so only on European Asian or Middle Eastern airlines that would offer generally a far higher service levels. The ""comfort plus"" product is a laughable one from Delta. Trying to sell seats with better leg room however seats scattered in the cabin with no better seats dedicated cabin or special menu. So not recommending this wanna-be premium economy. On board staff did their job but surprised of how detached they were from the passengers. Recommended airline but there are a lot of other better options in my experience.",1
"We flew home from Germany to Alberta Canada we had a stop over in Chicago IL. United Airlines had the worst service we have ever had from an airline company. The people were very unhelpful. Here is what happened an explanation of why we are so disappointed. The customer service was the worst we have had. It was our honeymoon we boarded our initial flight in Barcelona Spain with a different airline they flew us to Germany at which point we were to get on our UA flight. The first thing that annoyed us was that the UA airline baggage people didn't even make an effort to get our luggage on our first UA flight (this is something we didn't find out until we were already in Chicago). The lady we spoke to in Chicago simply said ""you had a short layover and in cases like that we don't get the luggage because its too difficult."" Once we were in Chicago and realized our baggage hadn't made it onto our plane we were told that it would be very easy to give the UA baggage office our address and they would ship them to us the next day. So we landed in Calgary (an hour late) and went to the UA baggage office to report our missing bags and give our address to them. We waited at their office for 1.5 hrs. This was a very frustrating experience in regards to the baggage and customer service. On a final note I would not recommend traveling with United Airlines (Lufthansa)!",0
"Flew Dreamliner - premium to Thailand 28th Jan return 12th Feb. When entering the aircraft first impressions were good feels airy light and spacious but once seated you start to notice the problems especially with the silly situation of the armrests between the seats jutting out too far to accommodate the entertainment systems where before these were housed in the back of the seat in front. Does not recline as far back as the old seats found it more comfortable to sit bolt up right as when trying to use the decline it made me slouch so not good for people with back problems also the seats are rather hard so my bottom was sore after a long 13 hr flight on the way back. My main grouch is the lack of ""service"" from the crew well basically there wasn't any. I don't think that premium has dedicated staff for that cabin anymore. Yes we appeared to get fed and watered first then they would vanish behind the curtain to the main section of the plane and you wouldn't see them for ages. Checked the most recent brochure which doesn't mention dedicated staff as in previous years so look's like cutting back on costs via staffing levels. There was also an issue with food orders on the way back for the main course which resulted in quite a few people not having their requested choice one of the cabin crew even had the cheek to say to a lady that she wasn't flying first class so shouldn't expect that service. Apart from when we first took off when the cabin crew came round with drink orders and also offered wine with our main course we were never offered another drink as on previous flights and a lot of times there was no one to ask anyway so what are we actually paying for? 3/4 extra inches and uncomfortable seating would be the answer. We have always flown premium when going long haul with Thomson but am now seriously thinking about cancelling our premium seating already booked for our next holiday. There are a few positives I liked that they have an extra loo in the cabin that there is a little area at the back of the last row of seating where you can stretch your legs and that there was ample storage.",0
FRA-MBA return. Flight was 12hrs delayed due to problems with the plane. Were brought to nearby hotel with shuttles. Got all the information we asked for. Flight was ok staff friendly legroom astonishingly spacious for a charter. No personal IFE though. Food nothing special. Return without any problems or delays.,1
Nov 23 TLL-RIX-DUS. Nov 26 MIL-RIX-STO. Convenient internet booking and check in clean and modern aircraft (Dash/737) friendly and attentive staff excellent in-flight magazine reasonable food to buy in Economy class. Departure from Milan to Riga 45 minutes late thanks to small size of CRiga airport and information from flight attendants no problems with very short transfer time to board RIX-STO plane.,1
I booked a flight from Toronto to Puerto Vallarta last June 2013 on an Air Canada flight for March/April 2014. I pre booked aisle and middle seats. I was switched to Rouge with no choice. I am 5'10' my legs were pressed against the seat back. Our seats were changed to window and middle. There was no entertainment. You could watch movies if you had the Air Canada app but we did not know that in advance. They also changed the return flight to March 31 so we missed one day's vacation no big deal if the service had been there. They also charged me $150 for a bike one way. I sent two emails to air canada but no reply.,0
Just returned from a trip to Shanghai from Brisbane in Business Class - first time in the 777's. The trip was excellent and price very low due to discontinuing Brisbane service meals were good and service good. No alcohol is not a problem you can bring your own but we did not bother - beds lie flat but ok.,1
PER-KUL-PER on new A330-300 in Premium Economy. Did not have high expectations but the airline and product surprised me. The lie flat seat is comfortable and I was able to get some sleep. The crew seemed to love their job answered call bells quickly and with a smile. The meal (Nasi Lemak on both legs) was fine. Be good if they had a western breakfast option for an 0700 departure. Don't get me wrong I love Malay food but the western option was smokey BBQ chicken - more suited to lunch or dinner. I would fly them again. Great value for money. The seat alone is worth it if you are happy with no frills on the meals and beverage.,1
Moscow-Rimini return (charter economy). Outbound flight was delayed for 45 minutes but we were warned about this fact by check-in attendants who were very nice and friendly (unusual for Moscow). Boarding normally organised then the bus to our plane A310 inside was bright and clean seats were ok (I'm 192 cm tall). Soon after departure drinks were served - only juices or water. The meal service was fantastic. I must admit that the meal service took them more than 15 hour. Inflight magazine interesting. Return flight departed earlier than expected boarding swift seating was more comfy. Flight attendants were better : very helpful and delivered what you need with a smile.,0
CDG to Riyadh in Y class on the A330-200. This was one of the worst travel experiences I have had in recent years. I booked with Saudi who codeshare on this day of the week and went to check in at the Saudi desks in 2C. This was a mistake but Air France counter staff nearby were rude and unhelpful. Their customer service skills were so poor. Air France insists you use the automatic check in when travelling in this cabin but after queuing and following on screen instructions the machine then prints a notice telling you to go to the desk for traditional check in. Boarding was ridiculously slow and badly handled. Scanners failed to read every other card and just two agents on duty had to input details manually. The flight was scheduled for 1330 and was full but boarding did not begin until after 1300. The Y class seating configuration is grotesquely cramped. Seats are narrow with very little space. Should the passenger in front recline their seat the minuscule television screen will be almost touching your nose. Riyadh is not an especially lengthy sector but six hours in these tiny and packed rows was five hours too long. The seats cause real discomfort. The meal was only just hot and not pleasant and the red wine offered was very poor quality. Cheap plonk. Crews had barely enough space to move the trolley. Air France makes much of the glass of champagne it offers to all passengers but every other aspect of the service was very unpleasant indeed. Not to be repeated.,0
KUL-DEL A330 newish plane flight departed on time. Extremely efficient FA's very happy and obliging. Purchased a couple of beers outbound that were reasonably priced. Legroom sufficient for me and I'm 6'2. Arrived into Delhi 10 minutes early. Excellent all round service.,1
"Orlando Sanford - Amsterdam September 27 2013. We flew back to Amsterdam with a 767-300 with winglets. The service on board of the personnel is professional. Legroom in Economy too. We reserved seats in the middle row they have the same leg room as economy comfort the latter is more expensive and has nothing more to offer than economy. The problem with this airline is not the legroom but the seat width. 16"" is way too narrow for such a long flight. We two adult males (5'11"") who sport a lot not overweight sat shoulder to shoulder. We had to move our body the whole time because the seats are extremely narrow. People at the window seats had less legroom but can rest against the window so they had more comfort. The narrow seats made the flight very tiring and stressing. We knew Arkefly is cheap but we didn't expect this. They cram one extra seat in width so instead of a normal 2-3-2 you get a 2-4-2 A330/787 setup in a narrow 767. Together with having to pay for every drink or additional food this made a very uncomfortable flight. Even the coffee had to be paid for only water was for free but that tap was next to the toilets and looked dirty with calcium attached. So despite the professionalism of the cabin crew we will never ArkeFly again. We read somewhere Arke is going to cram also an extra seat in de 787 like this. Their 787 goes from 2-4-2 to 3-3-3 777 setup. Horrible! In the end with paying extra for drinks and food and reserving a seat we were better off with United or Delta.",0
Buenos Aires-Madrid. The original ticket was through Madrid to Rome and I wanted to disembark in Madrid instead of going all the way to Rome for which they charged me EUR 70 but it took them 40 minutes at the check-in to execute it. Nearly missed the flight. The service onboard was very bad and inattentive. Most of ground and onboard staff speaks Spanish and poor English. I had the feeling throughout that they are barely on top of things they are doing so any request a bit out of ordinary causes problems. I had no major issues but overall it was the worst flight I ever had.,0
Further to my 9 August posting the saga continued. Qantas phoned us on 8th just before we left for Barcelona airport to tell us that our seats were required for a bassinet booking from Dubai to Sydney. When we boarded our flight in Dubai on Friday 8 August there was neither a baby nor a bassinet to be seen. They had simply given our front row seats to two other passengers rather than letting us have our reserved seats back. If this is how the Qantas/Emirates codeshare works I want no part of it. The Purser on the flight was bemused as he told us that they were not expecting any baby or bassinet at 43B and C. Also our flight from Dubai to Sydney was going on to Auckland and the menu for breakfast arriving in Sydney was almost identical to that for the Sydney to Auckland sector just some subtle changes. I have no idea what the Trans-Tasman passengers were actually served as our flight was diverted to Brisbane for fuel when Sydney airport closed due to fog. Our flight arrived in Sydney about 11.00 instead of 06.00. To add insult to injury Qantas could not even get our baggage onto our rebooked flight even though they had six hours to sort it out - not even on the following morning's flight across the ditch.,0
LHR to Brisbane return. The tv screens were not working the food was unacceptable until the last leg on the return journey Dubai to LHR when we got one good meal. The ladies toilet facilities at Brunei airport are something you do not expect from a country such as Brunei. We got stuck in Brisbane for a whole week nobody could tell us what was going to happen let alone giving us some compensation - every day we were told that there was another meeting in Brunei and nothing had been decided so there would be another meeting the next day - again with no news. After the whole experience I do not think I want to fly with them again.,0
KUL-TPE return in premium class. Well kept A330 comfortable angled lie flat seats. There were just 3 seats occupied and cabin was quiet and peaceful. 2 free bottles of water and a meal provided. Outbound flight was delayed by 1 hr return by over 2 no apology/explanation given. This Airlines has a lot of potential but substantial delays on both ways does not allow me to recommend this medium/long haul carrier.,1
Three trips between CCS and BLA. I found Conviasa to be clean modern friendly and welcoming. My Spanish is functional but quite basic and when I struggled there was usually multilingual staff even on the short hop from Caracas to Barcelona and back. Luggage allowance on this flight is a generous 30kg and a free drink is provided despite the flight time being only 30-40 minutes. Seats comfortable with more room than I was expecting. All in all Conviasa offer a superior - albeit slightly more expensive - service on this short route than do their competitors Avior.,1
1 Nov 13 EA 501 Washington DC to Addis Ababa on Dreamliner. 29 Nov 13 EA 815 Addis Ababa to Kilimanjaro Tanzania. 10 Dec 13 EA 814 Kilimanjaro Tanzania to Addis Ababa. 10 Dec 13 EA 500 Addis Ababa to Washington DC on ?Dreamliner. All travel in Economy. The worst flying experience my wife and I have had in over 50 years. Flight to Addis was a nerve racking 15 hours of shrieking children. Parents made little if any effort to control their children. Flight staff were non responsive and did nothing. Repeated requests to be relocated met with indifference and non-responsiveness. Entire flight staff were unsmiling. Dreamliner was more of a nightmare - the cabin was hot. The power ports for computers did not work. In fact the inflight entertainment system did not work at the start of the flight. Food barely edible. Once in Bole Airport it took 1.5 hours for bags to be off loaded. Flight to Kilimanjaro followed a similar pattern. Provided WITH misinformation sending us to the wrong departure terminal. Had to go through security twice and rush to another terminal to catch our flight. Conditions were chaotic with no support personnel the airline. Another aircraft full of screaming unruly children. Flight back to Addis Ababa was another disaster. The flight we were booked on arrived an hour late and during this time no Ethiopian Airline employee was available to provide any information. Our previously confirmed seats were not available on check in despite having a long-standing confirmed reservation. Arrived late in Addis and had to rush to make our connecting flight to Washington DC. Again no help and were put on the wrong bus. Dreamliner flight back to Washington DC was again a nightmare experience. Even fuller with uncontrolled children. The crew were even surlier more incommunicative and more negative than on the initial flight. Impossible to sleep or relax. Although other seats were available all requests to be moved were refused.,0
15/01/14 - TT244 18/01/14 - TT247. We flew with from Sydney to Gold Coast and back had a really great trip. Cabin and service was much better than expected. Recommended to all especially if you have a tight holiday budget!,1
Flight SKG-SXF one way. It was a full flight but still comfortable. Clean cabin friendly crew prices average. The only drawback was that they lost our luggage but it was handling company's fault. Overall recommended.,1
Kuwait to Kabul return. Flight operated by a B767 which was okay condition. The flight attendants worked hard as flight was full IFE is poor. There is one big screen at the front of the cabin. I would recommend Safi Airways to other people over Kam Air.,1
"My husband and I flew from Paris to Rome in June 2015. We were going to fly with Air France but their cheaper flights sold out too quickly and we missed out. Apparently there was a fire at FCO in May so they changed us to CIA but only gave me 2 days notice, which I was annoyed about. Turned out to be a blessing because we flew out of FCO and it was Crazy. I highly recommend CIA. Our flight was on time, no delays. Staff were pleasant. The seats were comfortable. I paid $12 extra for extra leg room so our carry on bags would be guaranteed to fit, as we weren't checking luggage. We both fell asleep promptly and missed any drink service or entertainment. I checked in online, knew all about the fees and charges so as long as you are prepared it shouldn't come as a shock. Either way, zero delays, zero issues, cheap flight. What more could you want?",1
Now that Flybe is one of Air France's partners we've no choice other than to fly with them to and from MAN and Paris CDG. We have had no problems so far with them on these journeys. We've also used them to fly from Newcastle to Belfast City with no problems. FA's have been professional and friendly. The planes used are not the newest Airbus aircraft but they are comfortable for the short journeys. The legroom is quite good-wish we could have that on our long haul flights. And even nowadays they give complimentary drinks and snacks (e.g. chips biscuits trail mix).,1
Flew from Delhi to Bangalore on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Good experience decent food and IFE for a very low price. Very comfortable seats was a bit late though.,1
Rome to Vienna. Only found them by chance. Went to PIsa airport to try and ge ta flight to Vienna and they could only offer flights around 600 euro and knew nothing of any cheap airlines flying from that part of the world. Got back to our hotel and one of the teams riders had found Blu Express for 44 euro to fly the next day. This was from Rome which was only 90 minutes drive from where we were staying. Super fast check in and friendly staff. Very clean planes but noticed the seats forward of the emergency exit are different from the rear section. What I did like in the rear section was the armrest will push outwards to make your seat wider. The crew told me this was an ex USA 737 and this is for fat passengers. Really nice crew and very professional. You pay on board for what you want and they are cheaper than most LCC airlines. Overall reall good airline and a god send to the monopoly that exists in Italy.,0
Flights from SRG-CGK-SYD vv all flights were on time and there was no problem with all the luggage. The flight from Jakarta to Sydney was using their brand new aircraft (A330) which was equipped with onboard Wifi. The seats were very comfortable and surprisingly they provide amenities (ear plugs eye shades shocks) for a 7 hours flight. My return flights was slightly delayed (15 minutes) however I arrived on time in Jakarta so I could still catch my flight back to Semarang. All entertainment was good plenty of choices. The food were tasty even though my flight from Sydney to Jakarta was running out of choices.,1
"I recently flew KE867 and KE868 from ICN to Ulaanbaatar (Mongolia). The flight attendants on these two sectors worked very hard. The aircraft's were A330-300 and the return flight was full. The amount of cabin baggage taken in by the passengers on board wouldn't have been allowed on either the American or European airlines. Most of the flight attendants were females and for the life of me I don't know how they were able to lift the heavy cabin baggage and put them up in the overhead lockers. Throughout the flight the flight attendants were cheerful and smiling. As for the food, cleanliness and other aspect of the travel on those two flights I give Korean Air 5 Star plus.",1
I've flown Etihad more than 20 times within the last 9 months. On my most recent flight last Tuesday I had the same great service as usual. The cabin crew were very open and friendly. Even if I couldn't sleep on the two flights the crew were offering drinks and food during the night time. Food was good as usual as well as the entertainment system. I love flying with this airline and can recommend it to everyone. Compared to others the seat comfort is good and I had plenty of leg space.,1
I flew from Seoul (ICN) to Kuala Lumpur (KUL) on an A330. Flight was delayed 1 hour but it didn't matter so much since we arrived at gate 30-40 mins before boarding and everything just seemed normal to me. Seat was very comfortable and food was not too bad. The touch screen wasn't working very well but still there were some good movies to watch. Staff were very kind although some were wearing too much makeup. The toilet was very clean. I would definitely fly with MAS again.,1
BNE to SIN via KUL. Excellent flight. The business cabin in the new A330 is really good and the crew is very accommodating. The satay is also extremely delicious. The 15.4 inch AVOD screen also had a good selection of movies. The amenity kit was the star of the evening. It had everything you could think and couldn't think of.,1
Paris - Auckland cannot fault performance of the cabin crew seats are comfortable. They supplied us with toothbrush paste padded eye mask and wipes and good entertainment. I also commend Incheon Airport's Tourist Transfer Hotel. We had a 10 hour layover in Seoul which was a bit daunting until we discovered the hotel. It cost us approximately 60 euros for 6 hours and we would have paid double that just to rest.,1
I fly over 100000 miles a year and I have never had treatment as bad as Iberia. Was scheduled to leave Sunday at 5:30 pm. Left at 8:30. Flew an hour and came back to Boston. They told us nothing - the flight attendants were hiding and the pilot literally told us the weather in Boston as if that had been our planned destination. Another hour on the runway and they finally let us off with no explanation. No one met the plane. No one apologized. No one told us what happened. We were eventually handed a tiny piece of paper with a phone number and were told to call after 10am the next day. Turned out that number was the worldwide call center for Iberia and they knew nothing. After many calls someone finally told me we would definitely be leaving that day around 5:30 but that I had to call back at 10. At 10 they said they didn't know but they would call us. When they hadn't called by 12:30 I called and they said I had to go right down to the airport. Raced to the airport where it was a madhouse and no one could explain anything. After almost 4 hours in line with no information from anyone they told me that they would put me on the next day's flight - something that certainly could have been done over the phone. On the flight two days late. No air-con for 49 minutes as we sat there. Pulled away only to pull back because of an electrical problem. Another hour with no air-con. Finally after a two-hour delay we took off.,0
I have just posted an extremely positive review regarding Jet2 Staff based at Ibiza Airport. However on the downside we had a very poor outbound flight to Ibiza due to a group of men on a stag party. They appeared to have been drinking heavily before boarding the plane and were very loud throughout the flight which was not helped by the cabin crew supplying them with even more alcohol. The crew did not attempt to ask them to tone down their behaviour which made it impossible to hear any announcements from the cabin crew of the captain. Altogether a very disappointing performance from Jet2 cabin crew on this occasion.,1
I had never flown with Vietnam Airlines however after my recent trip from Hanoi to Kuala Lumpur my opinion has changed. It was a comfortable flight with very nice staff and good quality food seats were comfortable.,1
Flight from Sydney to Beijing cancelled and changed to a different day without explanation. On the flight itself the service was cold and abrupt. My biggest complaint about this flight were my uncivilised fellow passengers. One lady cut in front of me in the queue during check in. Later in the flight I produced my phone / tablet (which was in flight mode) to check the time. I now realise I shouldn't have but the guy sitting beside me became aggressive in an animated fashion. I requested a move which the cabin staff to their credit quickly agreed to. Their English was extremely poor. I flew a total of four 8+ hour flights with the airline in the past month (Sydney - Beijing - Frankfurt - Shanghai - Sydney). The food was variable ranging from quite poor to somewhat edible and the Chinese red wine was sour and undrinkable. My main issue was uncivilised fellow travellers - I almost lost count of the amount of times I was pushed / shoved or cut in front of in queues during this experience. In addition when transferring through Shanghai I had to collect my luggage and re-check in mid way - they could not transfer my luggage directly from Frankfurt to Sydney. This was an unpleasant way to travel and I would not recommend the airline. You get what you pay for and if you do chose Air China be prepared for extra irritations and inconveniences.,0
Miami to Cleveland continuing to Syracuse NY. Plane was 15 minutes from SYR and returned to Cleveland. Eventual cancellation of SYR flight full plane. Sent to customer service line for 4 hour wait told no flights to Syracuse for 5 days. Would give us 1 night of hotel then we were on our own. Ended up having to spend $320 on car rental to drive to Syracuse. I was travelling with disabled husband and young daughter. Customer service (if you can call it that) was rude and nasty. I'm still trying to wrap my head around how I paid to fly then how it cost me an extra $320 to get home with a 7 hour drive. More than half the customers gave up on customer service line and left went directly to car rental.,0
VIE-ORD on Apr 9 on an 767-300 in Business Class. Slightly delayed arrival probably due to the French ATC strike. On board this was an excellent experience not the most modern plane but updated with the new business class and a very fresh look excellent 1-2-1 configuration with lie flat seats Business just half full. IFE was AVOD with large high quality screens movie selection was fine with some out of the box choices but after one flight I have watched what I wanted to see. FA's were professional attentive and friendly. Meals served were tasty and with Austrian and international choices and of restaurant quality. Lunch was a choice of various Antipasti from a carte soup a choice of 3 mains (very good prawn curry or Viennese veal goulash or pumpkin/ham pasta) and a choice of hot/cold desserts. The second meal was a choice of Salmon with potato cakes or Chicken Quesadillas. Wines served were predominantly from Austria. However drinks in general were just ok. Some drink runs between the meals additional drinks available in the galley. Non-Schengen OS flagship lounge in Vienna rather compact with an ok breakfast selection. However no coffee tea etc. as both machines were out of order. Check-in friendly and competent but boarding was a mess. Additional document control with security questions for US flights right before boarding was carried out by just one (1) employee for the whole plane leading to one very long not really recognizable - line. However there were four gate agents afterwards with nothing to do due the bottleneck at the document control. Due to the weird design of the new terminal it was then not even possible to reach the end of the line when the boarding process actually started in earnest. After a cattle call for boarding with no premium boarding whatsoever passengers from all directions literally stormed the check point and people who have been standing in line were kept waiting while employees directed other people to go first to simply get them out of the way probably one of the most incompetent boarding procedures I have seen so far. While the terminal design in VIE is no fault of OS the choice of the procedure used is OS's choice. Immigration in ORD was a breeze however priority bags were out whenever. So after some mediocre flights with OS within Europe this was an excellent experience in air but not so good on the ground. Still highly recommended for the quality of the long-haul in- flight services. (Star Alliance Gold).,1
Flew from Shanghai to Hong Kong on the 3rd of February with China Eastern (MU505). Flight was delayed by an hour. However the main issue I had was that half way through the flight the cabin filled with cigarette smoke. When I questioned the attendant she was rude and dismissive refusing to acknowledge what was apparent to everyone in the cabin.,0
LHR to SOF Airbus 320. Good fare staff friendly on-time flight. Nice that there's a bottle of water at your seat and you later receive a free sandwich. But the worse leg room I've ever encountered on a plane. I'm 6 ft (183cm) and the metal bar of the spring-loaded seat pocket jammed uncomfortably into my knee cap.,1
Travelled from Bangalore to Singapore and Singapore to Delhi last week (both ways stopped at KL). I must say that quality has gone down very much compared to 2008-9. The staff is not at all caring. The food was very oily. The staff is more concerned about finishing their tasks and are not really concerned about customer. Empathy is totally missing.,0
DEL-COK-DEL. Excellent flight both flights on time as we had pre-booked meals and seats check-in was a breeze. Overall highly recommended as a premium low cost carrier.,1
I have flown with US airways 3 times now and each time has been unpleasant. I wonder if this airline is ever on time. All flights were delayed - once for 12 hours. This time I flew to Puerto Vallarta from San Francisco. The flight to SF was delayed and I had to run with my carry on and barely made my connecting flight. On the way back the check-in service at Puerto Vallarta airport was appalling. I first was directed to a long line to get my boarding pass from a computer and then I had to wait in another line for the US airways staff to look at my visa. Had to board a bus to get to the waiting plane. I booked my ticket / seats well in advance and was not given the seats I had selected - I was seated in the middle over the wing on all flights - the one seat I did not want. When I complained I was told it was my fault for checking in late - I was early and had chosen my seat when I purchased the tickets. I was also told that I did not have the right status to guarantee my seat. On the flight from Phoenix to San Francisco also delayed it was difficult to even get a cup of water. All together a horrible experience. I will be paying the extra dollars for the non-stop service with Alaska Airlines next time.,0
Cox's Bazar to Dhaka non-stop and one hour flight on a Bombardier Dash-8-Q300 on June 12. Excellent webpage meant was able to purchase domestic Bangladeshi flights from the UK using a UK debit card. Customer service personnel in Dhaka very helpful over the phone when requested confirmed itinerary resent via email. Check-in a breeze. Nice cabin interior and smartly turned out FAs provided snacks and beverages. Flight left on time and arrived the same.,1
Business Elite MSP-SEA-PEK-SEA-MSP. All Sectors were excellent. International Service was fine. Food was good. All Flights were on time and had a chance to use the new immigration Kiosk's. It was a little faster. Not sure why but got a hand written note from the purser thanking me for my business. I see a definite improvement with Delta. I hope it continues.,1
"Throughout my recent trip, there were difficulties due to under-staffing at the terminals and ticket check-in, leading to several long delays. Several of us missed our first flight out of Gainesville since there was miscommunication leading to no one being at the check-out counter prior to our departure and none of the boarding pass kiosks working. The return flights were equally difficult, with only 1 kiosk working and only one person working the ticket counter, which lead to check-in requiring about an hour. Several of the initial flights were delayed, leading to several of us missing our connection. While this is understandable and does occur at times, it took approximately 2 hours to receive our hotel vouchers even though the flight arrangements were made prior. This was again due to being under-staffed as only 1 person was working this terminal. The following day, multiple flights were cancelled due to ""mechanical difficulties"" leading several of us to again miss our flights. This again lead to an almost 2 hour wait in order to re-book after already waiting an hour prior to the flight being cancelled, causing many of us to miss our chance at making a compatible connection flight. I was initially told I would again have to stay over-night and was not given further options. After calling customer service myself, I found a flight to an airport 2.5 hours away although I was required to pay the rental car fee to drive back home. In summary, due to consistent under-staffing, there were numerous long waits which ultimately delayed travel planned. This combined with several flight delays (due to mechanical difficulties - not weather), lead do my initial flight leaving a day late and my return flight being delayed 2 additional days. I travel fairly regularly, and have never ran across this issue previously. I will avoid using American Airlines in the future if possible.",0
Outbound flight Gatwick to Toronto was fine paid for extra leg room and the cabin configuration was the conventional 242 check in at Gatwick was in the bowels of the building and was tediously slow good in flight entertainment. Return flight was on their new 3x3x3 configuration which was like flying in a sardine tin. Did not get the extra leg room seats we had ordered and paid for the new configuration makes it impossible to get any sleep on night flights the aisles are so narrow that passing passengers stewards and trolleys bump into you all the time. This is the only overnight transatlantic flight I have ever taken where you need to buy or bring your own blanket! This is taking penny pinching to a whole new level. Food was edible but not a lot of it so if your planning to fly Transat take your own food with you avoid night flights and don't forget your own blanket shin and elbow guards! I suggest you consider another airline or book their business class option which is competitively priced but difficult to get as there are so few seats (3 rows I think).,0
I flew to Bali from Sydney for $88 on 23 April 2015. The flight left 10 minutes late and arrived 33 minutes early. The plane was the new Boeing Dreamliner and I managed to secure a window seat without paying extra. This new plane had sufficient leg room and seat width for me. I am 178 cm tall and weigh 96 kg. The earphones plug into the back of the headrest in front of you. There is also a USB socket next to the earphones jack. The windows of this plane darken gradually but there is a button underneath the window to lighten them. For the first time the Jetstar ground staff did not ask to see a ticket out of Indonesia even though I was not flying out of Indonesia with Jetstar. I only took a cabin bag which weighed 9.7 kg. The Jetstar ground staff let the bag through as I had purchased the ticket in October. Nowadays Jetstar only allows a maximum of 7 kg for cabin luggage. Onboard I purchased a red wine cheese and crackers package for $A10. Overall a very pleasant flight.,1
Malaga -Brussels in business. Flight delayed by 1hr average service not enough attentive to customers needs. Separation between business and economy b flex does not exist no privacy. Food is very average nearly bad and non tasty b flex meals seem better. The quality / price ratio was very bad a return ticket for a 2h45 flight is around 900 euros. Experience is not worth the money spent.,0
"Horrible experience. Left the gate in Norfolk late. Waited on the taxiway for 20 minutes prior to takeoff, allegedly due to a stoppage at Laguardia, the connecting city. One bathroom on the plane, which was dirty. Arrived at Laguardia a tad late, but not so late as to miss the connection. Then we sat on the taxiway at Laguardia for an hour because our gate was occupied, and missed our connection to Halifax. Now stuck in Laguardia from 11:30 am until 6:10 pm, arriving Nova Scotia at 9:30 pm. Half a day of vacation blown. Laguardia has nothing to do inside the airport. Delta refuses to comp anything. This was not a weather delay.  We are traveling with a couple who are Delta premium members. They went to the customer service desk in the private Skyclub to try to get something in the way of a comp. No satisfaction. They asked for a supervisor, who refused to even come to the service desk. Delta doesn't give a damn about customer service.",0
I fly with United because it is one the few alternatives to fly directly to Bogota. They do not respect the seat assignments. On 2 occasions they changed without explanation even though I had paid for economy plus set they sent me to the back I had to really fight to get one in economy plus. On a 5 hour international flight they give you nothing just a drink. No entertainment.,0
Amsterdam-Nairobi. Flight left and arrived on time food despite not looking appetising actually quite tasty. Staff relatively efficient. Seat back entertainment didn't work properly seemed to be hit and miss for most passengers. I'm 5ft 10 and I found seating on the 767 to be incredibly cramped much more so than the return flight on KLM. That and the position of the entertainment box under my B seat made it physically impossible to find a position in which to sleep.,0
The flight was on time. B767 is an old aircraft but maintained very well. Served seafood with rice. Very delicious. Many kinds of drinks. Aloe juice was very special. Cabin was clean. Seat was comfortable. Cabin crew were helpful and friendly. At the ICN airport ground staff were very hardworking. Check-in staff were efficient.,1
Gatwick to Lanzarote return planes clean and tidy cabin crew polite. Leg room okay no different than Easyjet. Flights on time outbound & return would have no hesitation booking with them again.,1
"We arrived at the airport in plenty of time to check bags - 30 minutes before boarding the flight was cancelled. Spent the next 3 hours waiting in line with the rest of the passengers. Apparently Spirit cancelled every flight departing from Houston at the last minute. All other airlines were flying without issue. Needless to say my entire vacation was ruined. 5 - 7 business days to refund the flight and baggage fees! The fare is not cheaper once you pay for all the ""extras"".",0
6th July flight to Washington cancelled. We had no warning and no e-mail to warn us but we checked the flight in the morning and after a lenghty phone call to Maxjet was put on a flight from Heathrow with Virgin economy class. No reason given for cancellation and promised a visit from a Rep when we got to Heathrow. We had to find the extra cost to Heathrow for a start Virgin was not expecting us but rallied round and got us on a flight a no show of course from the Maxjet Rep and so far we have not received a reply to our complaint from Maxjet. I waited as long as I could before I was forced to write this review but it seems they dont really care whether you fly with them or not! Be ready for cancellations and delays and no customer service. On a plus side we did fly back as planned from Washington(delayed) but it was a very comfortable. We had 3/4 hours restful sleep and the service on board was very good. I just dont know if i can trust them enough to use them again which is a shame as it could be such a good service.,0
I flew from Albany NY to Oakland CA to get married. When the crew found out I was getting married I was presented with a bottle of Korbel champagne! What a lovely gesture from an airline that puts service first.,1
Returned recently from Miami on Boeing 747. Service was exemplary boarding was prompt and seats very comfortable and quite spacious; films up to date varied and good screen quality. The much aligned airline food was perfectly acceptable and quite good. But the best thing about Virgin is the quality of cabin service excellent throughout the flight. The only negative is simply Miami International Airport which is unbelievable but even Virgin cannot resolve their immigration and custom delays and associated chaos.,1
"Frontier Airlines say their seats don't recline, but Row 13 is the only row where the seats do recline on their A319. I was seated on row 14 and as soon as the flight departed Denver (Flt 612 on July 26), the three people in front of me recline their seats and laughed loudly that they paid $50 more for a first class seats. Row 13 is an exit row. It made the overnight flight very uncomfortable for me since my seat did not recline and my knees were firmly pressed up against the seat in front of me for 3.5 hours. During the beverage service, the flights attendant approached each person saying, ""would you like to purchase a cocktail, soft drink, or snack"". I ordered a water and was surprised to hear her serving wine to the person directly behind me. I looked up at her and said excuse me and she just said, ""I'll be right with you"" with a bit of an attitude. I guess if I paid $4 for the water I would have been served before the person behind me. When you add up the flight, extra costs ($3 for a seat selection, $25 for a carry-on bag, $30 for a checked bag, and $4 for a soda or $6.99 for a beer), I really didn't save anything by flying Frontier. I am most surprised that Frontier apparently charges $50 more for Row 13. It seems very unfair the only row that reclines is Row 13 and anyone seated on Row 14 gets a seat back in there face. I gave it a try, but I will not make that mistake again. Frontier may be a discount carrier, but they are not the cheapest once you start adding in all the extras. Buyer beware.",0
"I have been a summit member for over ten years. They have methodically reduced all of the benefits for being a frequent flier until they are now nearly non-existent. The staff on the phone when you can get through are tired and it is easy to see that they very much dislike their jobs. The flight attendants on too many of my recent flights are also grumbling and service is sketchy at best. On a recent flight from Denver going south the attendants did not start the beverage service until we were more than two thirds the way to the destination and did not prepare the cabin for landing until the pilot announced ""Attendants please prepare for landing."" Speaking with a number of people we have all encountered hang-ups when trying to speak to an agent.",0
I have just arrived back in the UK after the journey from hell the April 02 flight 72 hours from Bangkok to Gatwick. After being stranded in Sharjah UAE for 60 hours and an almost total lack of communication from Phuket Air I can do nothing other than urge anyone who is planning on taking a flight to cancel their tickets immediately and find someone/anyone other than these clowns to travel with.,0
LHR-DME. We flew an ageing 737. The plane was packed and everyone had a lot of hand luggage so there was little room for storage. Cabin crew were completely indifferent to boarding passengers and did their best to ignore them. Absolutely no assistance was offered The steward at the front of the plane used his position to glare at everyone. Departure was delayed for about an hour of course no announcements. We were offered a soft drink and that was the last liquid we saw for the next 3.5 hours. One got the impression that the cabin crew had decided that it wasn't worth the bother of attending to passengers and they all walked about with morose and sulking expressions. I would only ever consider Transaero if the price was significantly lower.,0
We travelled Air India business class in December 2014 and recently from London to Mumbai and Delhi to London. We found the plane modern and clean and the crew were delightful. The reviews we read did not resemble our experience and as regular business class passengers on other airlines we were very happy with the experience. The only critique was that the food was a bit limited and not as proficient as other airlines. The seats were spacious and the flat beds very comfortable and we will definitely be using this airline again.,1
Our flight from Heathrow to Colombo was without doubt the worst flight experience I have had. I don't sleep on long haul flights so distractions and entertainment are absolutely essential for me. It soon became apparent that there was a problem with our system in our window side seats with the entertainment system we alerted a cabin crew member who said they would reset the system no follow up communication was received and the system still did not work and after food had been served staff were not very visible and as the flight deck also operates the call button this was not an option either as it was not working. Eventually a second flight attendant was alerted and again we were told that it would be reset again nothing was done. A third member of staff was told of this and yet again nothing was said or explained to us. 9 hours had passed during this time and I was going stir crazy no sleep and not even able to read as the controls also operate the reading light. Eventually it was time for our second meal and we made one last attempt to resolve the problem and this time the staff member had the guts to admit that it was not working and would not do so for the flight and that several other people were affected as well. 11 hour flight with no entertainment whatsoever no way to read or call a flight attendant they were rarely present between meals and the only way to get there attention was hope someone else used the call button. No offer of refreshments between meals and fairly surly staff this is not acceptable treatment for human beings trapped in a metal tube for such long periods of time and should be taken very seriously by the Airline. I was praying that it would be over and have never been so relieved or eager to leave an Aircraft. In defence all of our short flights were fine and the return flight from Colombo to Heathrow was such a staggering opposite to the original that I find it hard to believe that they are the same airline unfortunately the first experience was too terrible.,0
I would refrain from using this budget again especially on long flights like Sydney-KUL as even basic essentials like free access to drinking water is charged for seats are ridiculously narrow (9 abreast when the Airbus seating should have been 2-4-2 rather than 3-3-3). Not good for long haul passengers.,0
LH453 24/3/2015. LAX-MUC economy class. Seats were extremely comfortable and with lots of space. Meals were very good. Inflight entertainment was good with new several new releases and a reasonably vast choice of movies Staff was extremely friendly and helpful. I have non doubt that the service provide on this flight was comparable (if not better) to that provided by other 5-stars rated airlines.,1
My husband and I have travelled the world with many different airlines and I must say that Ryanair are great. We travelled to Las Palmas Gran Canaria on 19th April returning on 29th both ways no delays and on time. Staff were great friendly and worked so hard up and down the aisle serving drinks and food nothing to much trouble. You are lucky if you get one drink on other airlines even sometimes on long haul. The only problem the seats were a little hard. We will definitely travel again with Ryanair.,1
Apart from having point to point connection there is nothing else that this airline can offer. I flew from Dubai to Amritsar and back and found this trip rather exhausting and uncomfortable due to the airline service. Being a budget carrier does mean to save costs but its doesn't mean to keep your aircraft's dirty and unhygienic. When I entered the aircraft both the times I felt as I am traveling in one of those public buses which are disposed for public use (to be honest even public buses are well maintained that Air India Express aircraft's) the crew looked angry for no reason it felt as if they were punished to come here and serve us they did not have the decency to speak politely with passengers and just dumped their frustration on us. Food was awful as everything looked stale and had no taste. Since this was the only flight available for me to reach Amritsar I was forced to take it.,0
Just returned from a weekend break in IBZ and used LS on both sectors. You can't escape the fact that their B733 have seen better days however both flights were on time and the GLA based crews were fantastic. Exceptionally friendly polite and very professional. Some other GLA based crew with other charter carriers would do very well to learn from their example.,1
AMS-MEX-AMS. Seated in Economy Comfort. Very spacious leg room. Seat a bit narrow. The seat was very hard and was uncomfortable after a short time. From AMS food was good and tasty with good presentation. On the flight back the food was below acceptable with same side dish for both dinner and breakfast. Inflight entertainment fine without being extraordinary. Cabin service was fine but not extraordinary.,1
Heathrow Marrakech. Had previously travelled on the British Midland service with mixed results. Things seem to have improved since the take-over and integration of services. Staff more attentive both on the ground and inflight. Meals seem to have improved too. There has been a real lack of choice on this route (still is) but hopefully the improvement will be consistent.,1
Yangon to Lashio in November 2009 ATR 42 plane. Allocated seating and good snack served with excellent customer service. Would fly with them again any time!,0
LAX to YVR. I travel this route regularly and have witnessed Westjet's standards and service decline. This flight was 2 hours late leaving LAX. No warning provided by ground staff at LAX. No apology or explanation by pilot once onboard. IFC bored. Aircraft dirty Westjet still continue to refer to passengers as 'guests' yet increasingly do not treat them as such. Air Canada product now is consistently superior.,0
The aircraft was clearly very old cramped seats with extremely limited leg room. Drop down tvs overhead not seat back screens. Extremely old films overhead screens were just inches from my head and there was a warning on the back of the seat about this. Could not move my arms easily in order to eat my meal due to the lack of space. Unsmiling surly staff on the outbound flight (UK to Cape Town) better on the way back. Breakfast inedible. Uncomfortable flight with many people clearly unable to sleep. The overhead light would have disturbed other passengers so I couldn't read and with no proper in flight entertainment I simply sat in my seat for 11 hours bored out of my mind.,0
Kos-Stansted. Our first time on Ryanair and I have to say never again. Stress re-packing our 52kg luggage into the correct number of bags after a day on the beach. Stress getting the hand luggage re-weighed. Stress standing crammed into a much too small area with all the other cattle. No facilities (refreshments or toilets) in 35 degree heat for 45 minutes. Stress barging through to the plane. Stress with the bright lights and constant announcements. No quick hostess service followed by a dimming of the lights so you can sleep. Awoken every 20 minutes to an automated scratchcard announcement. Uncomfortable seats which seem to have less padding than others. I landed with a headache which wrote off the following day. Quite frankly it's not worth the saving to put up with the constant barrage of sales attempts.,0
Newark to London Heathrow 4 June. Found them ok in all areas. Plane very clean drinks brought around regularly. Seat comfortable with plenty of legroom.,1
The worst business class flights we have ever had. Sloppy service the poorest food ever and served with some parts cold. I have had better service on EasyJet. I was served tea in a mug with the tea bag left in and no spoon to retrieve it or anywhere to put the sopping tea bag. I was served cheesecake with nothing to eat it with no spoon or fork. My breakfast that was the worst I have experienced on any airline was part warm part cold and partly hot I did not eat it and it stayed on my tray for over twenty minutes before a stewardess removed it. On my return flight from Delhi I was served cold chicken tikka. There was an empty seat opposite that was hot bedded by numerous people don't know who they were or where they came from. I wrote to Virgin 4 times before I got a response sloppy on the planes and sloppy after service.,0
All in all had a great trip to Punta Cana. Travelled from Newfoundland via Gander/Deer Lake. Sunwing almost had the deal sealed as a repeat customer. Check in from Deer Lake was terrific. Staff were excellent. Flight down and crew were also great. The Sunwing check in experience to come home left us feeling robbed and disgruntled. At some point Sunwing needs to incorporate 'Discretion' in to their operations. At the end of the experience getting off the plane back home I was left with the 'lasting' feeling that everything was a mere money grab for Sunwing when I had supposedly already paid for a 'Premium Options' package when I purchased my package. They are the masters at smoke and mirrors when I compare Sunwing to other tour operators I have used to travel to the Dominican Republic from Atlantic Canada in the past. Neither my wife nor I will rely on Sunwing to do that again if it is within our power to determine so. Ironically I don't really think that Sunwing even cares.,0
Sydney-Santiago-Sao Paulo. An uneventful flight with a good crew on board. I was fortunate to have the only spare Y class seat on my flight next to me. Food good drinks good but the wine glasses were thimbles. IFE is fantastic! I needed assistance at the SCL Airport transfer desk and LAN staff seemed a little overwhelmed but did their best to resolve. Appreciated the English - and I tried my hand at Spanish with good result!,1
Paris/CDG-Athens on A321 aircraft. Wonderful service in economy class although flight was delayed for almost 3 hours due to very bad weather conditions (heavy snow). Cabin crew was one of the best I have met on a flight. Meals in Y/C need some improvement.,1
My first flight from LAX was cancelled. Did leave the next day. However I missed my next flight from Nadi to Savusavu. Had to overnight in terrible hotel and bad food. Return trip flight cancelled from Savusavu to Nadi. Had to overnight 2 nights in another bad hotel with even worse food. I spent 4 extra days in travel on one trip. Air Pacific does not care about customer service because they are the only airline that goes direct from LAX to Fiji. I spent $6000 on air fares and stayed at the same hotels as coach customers. Meal vouchers were also at the same restaurants.,0
Helsinki to St Petersburg - short flight 2hrs or so. Seat pitch was fine plane was exceptionally old still had ash trays smelt of musky smoke must have been flying in the 1960's. Flight staff dont speak English only Russian which was ok no need to talk to them. Flight was delayed by an hour or so due to snow. Actual flight was a bit scary... never been scared on any flight before but Rossiya Air brings about a whole new flying experience. I probably would fly them again if I was desperate or on a tight budget otherwise fly BA or Finnair.,0
"AC1914 May 17 2014. Flew from Toronto to Barcelona. A little over 8 hours. The seats were cramped with no legroom. I am 5' 3"" 118 lbs and could barely fit. No entertainment unless you had an IPAD. Then you could use their system or rent one for 10 bucks! Asked for a blanket. Another 10 bucks for purchase only. Asked for a glass of wine. Another $6.50! The one meal that we received was horrible. The ""snack"" was a dry piece of cake.",0
SGN-AUH-BRU on 02/01. Worst experience in my 30y plus frequent travelling. The flight departed SGN ca. 1 hour late which still left enough transit time in AUH. During the descend into AUH the cpt announces severe problems with fog and was ordered to circle till further news. On top the lighting system on the runways broke down due which further circling needed. After ca. 30 mins circling the plane is diverted to a nearby airport where we stand at the ground for 3 hours. We then head back to AUH (15 min flight). The crew assures us that no flights departed and all connecting flights would still be there. Ground staff guided us to the premium lounge at T1 where the desk clerk told us the BRU flight left already anyway and she would rebook us onto the next flight. Whilst I wait for the rebooking I see the original BRU flight appearing on the screens for departure 13hr. I notify the clerk who denies the screen data but confirms it after checking again anyway. It's ca. 7am at that moment. She tells us to move to the T3 premium lounge. The desk clerk there confirms the 13h departure and tells us to sit and wait in the lounge till the boarding is announced at gate 44. At that moment gate 44 shows boarding for Brisbane. The next few hours I check on a regular basis with the staff for any change (AUH is in total chaos at that time). Each time they confirm the details. At 12h still no boarding and we're told flight is further delayed but they will announce boarding in time. At 13h30 I go to the gate where the screen still says Brisbane flight is boarding. I ask the boarding clerk if BRU is next after Brisbane to which she tells me she is boarding Dublin at that moment and the BRU flight left 30 minutes ago. What happened then is just too much for words to describe. We ended up being moved to a hotel at 6pm rebooked to the next day's Alitalia flight to Rome with a connection to BRU. Arriving in Rome the next day it turns out we're not in the system for the connecting flight to BRU and both Alitalia and SN flights are fully booked. As a last resort I went to the Vueling ticket counter where they had luckely still 3 seats left on the 18h05 flight which I had to pay for myself. So instead of a planned arrival into BRU on 03/01 at 7am we finally arrived at 04/01 at 9pm. Needless to say without luggage. Unless the only other option is going by foot I will never fly Etihad ever again.,0
September 2013. Eindhoven NL - Bucharest RO. At check-in I was told to put my hand luggage (a size accepted by all airlines as hand luggage) in the luggage sizer. I fly with that luggage once a month. Of course it did not fit so they asked me to pay another 35 euros. Onboard seats are terrible service non existent. I am surprised there is no bathroom fee. If you have an alternative use another airline.,0
CGK-HKG-CGK all in A330-200 with 2-4-2 seat configuration. I got USD 485 for return tickets. Comfortable seat with good pitch and width. Welcome drink and delicious meal. Great entertainment system. Attentive cabin crews. Cabin cleanliness is good but need more attention. Definitely will fly with Garuda again in my next trip to Japan.,1
"I didn't even succeed in making a booking! This company is the worst I have ever encountered in any field in the whole of my life. Their online booking system is a joke. It just does not work!  Anyone who experienced the same online booking problems that I encountered would just give up. I could not even enter my date of birth, and when I finally got to the payment section after three hours of trying, two of my credit cards were refused despite being asked for the advanced security codes. My recommendation to Wizz Air is just to give up.  I have only selected a rating of 1/10 because I could not register 0/10.",0
Flew from YYC-EWR-YGK-YYZ-YYC. Flight left on time. It was 60% full mostly people on business but for me it was vacation. Got some apples and some noodle soup. The soup was salty but fine and the apples were surprisingly good. The inflight entertainment system was good and tons of choices. Flight from YGK-YYZ was a 1-1 configuration which was different and no drinks served but only a 50 minute flight and no flight attendant or cockpit door. Flight from YYZ-YYC was an A320 and same entertainment system but the flight attendants gave all the kids on the plane ice cream and cookies left over from the Executive Class passengers.,1
Milan - London LHR. A320 in Air One colours Leather seats but very dirty. Entire row of 6 had no inflight magazines two seats (out of 6) had a sick bag safety cards had chewing gum stuck to it. For over 2 hrs flight we were given A CHOICE of tiny pack of biscotti or salty snacks and a drink. Cabin crew spoke proper English but were not interested in any kind of service. I flown low costs with much better service than this.,0
Flew from SCL to MAD via BOG - Airbus 330. The service was superb. Food is good. Not as many wines as on LAN but I paid one third of what LAN charges on the same route same dates. Seats are very good even though not fully horizontal. Good headphones. Some of these planes have good space for carry on baggage others are way too small. Their frequent flyer program is very good. Some nice details are the flower they put on the meal tray and the a small package of Colombian coffee they give you as a present to take home.,1
Recently flown Emirates while on holiday with my family to Singapore and Sydney from New Zealand. I have very specific requirements when traveling due to using an electric wheelchair for mobility. Despite emailing the airline in advance with these requirements I had a distressing experience using this airline. It was awful from check-in to landing. The customer service was terrible at the check-in desk. The Emirates crew at Sydney airport were unfriendly and they were more interested in talking amongst themselves. At check-in I explained that I'd like to drive my wheelchair up to the entrance of the plane. Check-in staff made a lot of calls and eventually they assured me they were happy with my request. Having reached the gate with my family the bad service continued. The lady at the gate was surprised to see me and asked why I wasn't in a transit chair. She refused to process my boarding early. She ignored my explanation regarding my wheelchair and brought out a transit chair for me to transfer into. When I refused she made more calls and finally she allowed my family and I to continue toward the entrance of the plane. On board usually when a passenger with a disability is onboard a Cabin Service Manager (CSM) comes to say ?hello?and make sure all is OK. I was totally ignored. The food was terrible to say the least. Flight attendants did not seem interested in passengers. When we landed I had to wait for other passengers to get off first. Once the cabins were cleared I was told that a chair was on its way. 15 minutes later she showed us to a transit chair. My heart sank. I asked where my chair was and I asked that it be brought to the entrance of the plane instead. I pointed out to her that she clearly saw me board the plane with my chair and I was requesting the same procedure to happen in order for me to get off the plane. Within a few minutes my chair was brought to the plane. What could have been a very simple problem to resolve turned out to be a nightmare. I am hesitant to travel with Emirates again.,0
"My daughter and I travelled to Fort Lauderdale with you on the 22nd December. The flights cost Â£1506! I was very disappointed with the flight in view of the cost. I have flown to the Far East many times and expected the same standard of food service etc. I am in my late 70's and feel the cold. I had to purchase a blanket. On Far East flights which are cheaper than Norwegian you also receive a pillow. During long haul flights on the Far East airline stewardess's walk up and down handing out soft drinks for those that cannot sleep. The food left much to be desired. - two tiny sandwiches for breakfast 3"" x 1"" and the evening meal was no better with cold pasta added?",0
Oct 30 2013. Flight MU756 from Kunming to Shanghai was delayed for about 2 hours. Passengers were informed the delay was to wait for a few late passengers. Consequently I missed the flight from Shanghai to Vancouver because of the delay. Whoever at China Eastern made the decision to wait for late passengers without considering the connecting flight passengers should be fired. At least four connecting flight passengers were affected and missed the flight to Vancouver.,0
SÃ£o Paulo - FlorianÃ³polis. I've been using different domestic airlines in Brazil and Avianca really surprised me. Their service is something apart from what we are used to. Both ground and flight staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The service quality is premium even on economy class flights. Clean new and modern airplanes above average onboard service good food and drinks entertainment comparable to international level airlines.,1
My wife and I flew business class to Paris from Miami this past month. We found the service to be excellent. The lounges at both airports were spacious well stocked and service personnel to be friendly and very helpful. While we had not heard a great deal about the airline prior to our trip we were quite impressed and would certainly utilize it again in the future.,1
We flew Brisbane to Vancouver via Auckland (NZ 136/84 outbound) and return (NZ 83/135 inbound) We chose Air NZ based on recommendations and rating - boy were we disappointed. The aircraft (with the exception of NZ 135 seriously needs refurbishing the seats were hard and very cramped for long haul travel the IFE was terrible  the picture quality was poor to say the least and because there are no inflight magazines it took some time and patience to navigate. As experienced travellers one could only say that the food was as bad as it gets and if you want water after meal service you have to go look for someone to serve you. It would be nice if Air NZ would get into the current technology century and provide USB chargers in every seat not just in Business Class as were informed mid fight. Don't fall for the trap of paying extra for preferred seating unless you can fluke an exit row or bulkhead seat this is just a money grabber for the airline.,0
Our flight was from LAX to Shanghai. Our flight left on time both directions. The plane was clean and the seats were fairly comfortable. They reclined much more than a lot of economy class flights I've been on. We were served two full meals and one snack. The food was probably a 3 on a scale of 1-5. Not as awful as I expected. Usually chicken pork beef or fish with noodles or rice. We did get salads on the LA leg. They only served red wine and beer and when the two bottles of red wine was gone that was it. No mixed drinks. Our flight attendants spoke a little English and were courteous. My big complaint was I booked this flight through Webjet and it was difficult to confirm our flight. Tried calling several times and was on hold for over 45 minutes once with no answer. Web site was difficult to navigate I eventually emailed China Eastern and was told I was confirmed. I was unable to choose seats. If you can choose your seats try rows 70-74 with window seats as there are only two seats instead of three. I was able to score these seats on the return flight. The inflight entertainment was excellent with over 50 English speaking movies to choose from as well as some foreign films and games.,0
New York to San Francisco 20 Dec 2014 AA179. San Francisco to Los Angeles 25 Dec 2014 AA2378. Los Angeles to Las Vegas 30 Dec 2014 AA182. Las Vegas to New York 4 Jan 2015 AA120. My partner and I were extremely disappointed with everything. All 4 flights were delayed not by few minutes but by hours. Later the staff would board all passengers on to the aircraft and in all the flights we would just sit on the tarmac for hours. Usually when you board the plane the CSD or the purser of the flight would greet you with a friendly smile and say welcome aboard or good morning etc. But in all the flights with AA they could not care less about passengers. Flight attendants were too busy talking to each other or. The grooming of the flight attendants was atrocious! Above all the flight attendants on all 4 flights were very rude and arrogant. They don't even bother to look or smile or talk politely with the passengers when they are boarding the flight. The seats in economy was so uncomfortable with minimal leg room. There is no comfort. It is okay for short flights but not very good for long flights like New York to San Francisco or Las Vegas to New York. We paid extra for extra legroom economy seats. Well AA should learn what extra legroom means. There was no extra legroom. The seats are terrible for tall people. I will never recommend AA.,0
First experience of split flights - stop overs in FCO on way out and LIN on way back (LHR-CAT return). Booking flights only possible via Expedia (avoid) - simply did not show up on Alitalia website which also not good for non-Italian speakers. On line check in a delight. Ground staff not great - on way back told we were too early for check-in. Main problem was both initial flights were delayed an hour taking off and connection times were tight causing anxiety. In the event pilots radioed ahead flights were connected with and baggage no problem. Be aware there is no food on Millemiglia flights.,1
30 December 2013 Paris to Tbilisi via Munich LH2237 and LH2556. 8 January 2014 Tbilisi to Paris via Munich LH2557 and LH2230. Check-in was easy and pleasant with brilliant ground staff in Tbilisi. On board cabin crew were polite and hard working especially on the MUC-TBS leg on 30 December. Hot food was served in MUC-TBS-MUC segments and it was very tasty both times. Lufthansa and Turkish are recommended airlines for travelers to Tbilisi.,1
Virgin Upper Class LHR-HK return. A340-600 in each direction. Only 9 people in Upper Class on the way out busier on the return. Crew good - the problems come from the seat and the Vera entertainment. The latter has a very small screen for this class (compared to say Austrian or Swiss) awful music selection (surprising) and generally feels old. The seating is awkward - shoulder light cannot illuminate the dinner table due to angle seat upright is narrow for anyone with broad shoulders and horizontal sleep impossible for the same reason. Gangways are small. The bar area is not workable with one more person in it. Overall disappointing whilst other airlines have progressed this has not in some time.,0
We traveled recently on a trip that was American Airlines to our destination but Frontier on our return. I have no complaints about the flight itself. We were delayed due to necessary de-icing but the captain and flight attendants kept us informed and we were grateful to arrive at our final destination only a couple hours late. My only complaint would be that they don't know how to seat people we were in a group of 4 (2 couples) and they seated us all over the plane in middle seats between people who were traveling alone. We weren't allowed to pick our seats or change them so that even couples could sit together. I just feel that if you book your trip early enough as we did there should be no excuse for such a terrible job of seating us.,1
GA 828 (CGK-SIN) and GA 831 (SIN-CGK) both flights departed on time cabin crews were friendly as usual food on both sectors was delicious but the portions were too small plenty of drink choices. Cabin and toilet were clean. No complaints with the service.,1
On August 17th my wife and I flew to Paris on Icelandair to spend one week celebrating our anniversary. Though the trip itself was wonderful our flight back turned out to be an awful experience due to terribly poor customer service. Our first flight was to Reykjavik from Paris a shorter flight departing at 8am. We arrived at the gate at 7.30 only a very short while after formal boarding had finished. The Icelandair gate agent was unwilling to discuss our boarding but instead referred us to another location giving the false impression that we would be better assisted there. Following direction we went to the main Icelandair kiosk to discuss our travel. While the gate attendant was short and non-amenable to our boarding the main attendant at the Icelandair kiosk was downright rude uncooperative and completely void of any empathy. The only choice we were given was to return our hotel and come back the next morning to purchase new tickets at full price. We ended up purchasing our tickets back from AA. Ultimately I have never experienced a more uncooperative airline. These days people shop not only for good prices but good service. I recommend that you don't waste your time or money with Icelandair.,0
SEA-CLT-HHH return. Not a single flight was on time. Crews were indifferent at best and otherwise berating their employer to passengers. Their primary interest was in getting credit card applications. Seats were extremely tight in first noticeably less pitch than narrowbody flights on United or American. No entertainment no power outlets. The food was tragic on the outbound edible on the return but served without linens and with a paper napkin. No milk for coffee on domestic flights. Although I had a revenue first class ticket for $1700 US Airways still wanted me to pay extra for better seats on each flight(!) The Charlotte hub was a mess signs were broken moving sidewalks inoperable and my gates changed on the spur of the moment in each direction. Bags took close to 45 minutes to be unloaded in Seattle about 20 minutes in Hilton Head.,0
FR2282 WMI-STN 26th May. Warsaw Modlin airport gate area far too small not enough seats and chaos. Priority boarding queue sort of worked but not as smooth as it should be. Seat 1A excellent and first off on arrival. Aircraft departed late and never made up the time so we were just over thirty minutes late into STN. Information excellent though as to delay from flight crew and delay not that bad. Cabin crew OK and for price paid flight was very good.,1
Porto-Madrid business class. Ridiculously small space in Business class the same very narrow space as in economy. There are just 8 business class seats but if full as in my case it is no joy at all and the service is poor too. The flight left in time it was short so endurable. On arrival in Madrid the luggage was off-loaded right beside the aircraft and we had to take it from there ourselves.,0
Non-stop flight in November from Taipei (TPE) to Paris (CDG) on the Royal Laurel Class. The new lounge at Taipei is renovated with somewhat night club decor and mood lighting. Its spacious not over crowded and with a lot of food and beverage selections. However there was long wait for the showers so be aware to allow at least one hour before departure if you wish to take a shower. The new Royal Laurel class is indeed one of the best business class hard products in the industry. The seat is spacious and extremely comfortable. Each seat has direct aisle access and a lot of storage. The pillow and comforter are in good quality. EVA also serves Dom Perignon as pre departure drink which is indeed a plus on already quite impressive hard product. The service was a little disappointing. The crews seemed to be exhausted and just wanted to get things done as soon as possible so in general it lacked the personal touch and interaction with passengers. To be fair my glass was never empty and crews did come by promptly when I hit the call button. The food was adequate but not fantastic and portions were skimpy. A couple of small things I felt somehow to shadow the whole relatively positive experience. One is the crews retrieved the menus while passengers falling asleep. I felt it was sneaky and to be green in the wrong way. In short good hard product and adequate food and service. I will be happy to fly EVAs Royal Laurel Class again.,1
"Horrible to say the least! My first experience was not one to remember. San Francisco to Auckland on an old plane with ripped seats flight 7 seat A40. The entertainment system was broken in my seat nice job for 12 hours watching nothing with no seats to move to. Once I arrived to Auckland found out not only was my first trip cancelled to Palmerston North but they cancelled it again for the second time each time having to retrieve my luggage and go through the process all over. Then to add insult to the situation they put me on my third flight now 6 hours after when I was supposed to fly and there was a flight which left in between this time frame and I wasn't put on that because it was ""oversold"". My advice don't fly them.",0
Service was not good time keeping both ways was poor and on the return a delay of 6 hrs with little information from staff. Very expensive for what it was only soft drinks and a small pack of biscuits both journeys. Thought it would be better considering BA share this flight.,0
Was scheduled afternoon of 8/11/14 to fly from Lansing MI to Minneapolis then on to DFW. About 2.5 hours before flight received automated call that flight from Lansing had been cancelled and that they would call back with a rebooking (no explanation given as to why the flight was cancelled). Automated call back had put me on a flight out the next day at around 1.30 in the afternoon getting me to Dallas about 5.30pm on 12th. I called back and managed to get rebooked on a flight on the 12th leaving Lansing to Detriot at 6am then on to DFW getting in around 9.20am the next day (an effort to try to salvage most of the work day on the 12th). Arrived to Lansing airport about 4.30am on the 12th only to be told that the 6am flight was also cancelled (again gate agent had no explanation of why the flight was cancelled). Their only option was to put me on the same afternoon flight the automated service had booked me on the previous day. My 80-something year old parents ended up driving me to Detroit to make the 7.28am connection. Complained to Delta and was given a refund of about $29 (which I haven't seen yet). This didn't even cover the cost of the fuel my parents used to get from Lansing to Detroit and back).,0
MXP-DXB-BKK-DXB in Business. As usual I found the biz product to be excellent both on A380 and on B773. VIP lounge in Milan is brand new with plenty of seats and amenities with direct separate boarding directly from the lounge. Once on board seats are very comfortable high quality food and drinks smiles and kindness from all the crew. The only weakness is concerning boarding procedures at Bangkok that don't allow priority at all once pre-boarded is all chaotic so you have to literally walk over economy class passengers. EK is one of the most comfortable J class in the market I'll fly with them again.,1
Someone had mention in reviews that it was too cold during the flight. Well it should be an advantage Our flight from London to Sao Paulo was a nightmare due to lack of air conditioning on. I prefer to wrap in blankets and extra clothes rather than not having any air at all. We asked staff several times to turn it on but nothing happened. Staff were very friendly though good entertainment panel.,0
All I can say is that the experience was second to none. Staff were excellent courteous and helpful and the flights were fine both ways - Toronto-Calgary return. We are traveling with Westjet again in 2 weeks to the Mayan Riviera and are actually looking forward to it.,1
My family and I were flying from Cancun to San Antonio with what was supposed to be a short stop in Houston. Because the plane departed late from Cancun we made it through the long lines and customs with 15 minutes left to make our gate. That is until they called me back and said they won't take my luggage. I asked why and was told there was not enough time. We told them we could easily make it to the gate and they refused to let us go. Instead we were sent to the ticket counter to. Rebook our flight. That is when we were told the flights were booked and we might not leave till the next day. They were not willing to work with us at all and it just infuriated us more. We asked to speak to the manager and he also came off as arrogant and took no responsibility for our situation. We ended up having words with him that got us nowhere. That was the last flight with United that we will take.,0
Flight was cheap. Flew from Duluth MN to Las Vegas. The flight out was freezing and the flight back was hot. They save money by not turning anything on until you're in the air. No assistance from staff and the pilot remarked more than once that they are only on the plane for our safety. They just talked to each other the whole flight each way. Did load the App on my phone and scanned ticket so we saved money. You get what you pay for. Just be ready for it and read the fine print.,1
Just returned from Hawaii using Air Canada and never again. We got to the airport in Vancouver to find that the flight was going to be 3 hours late leaving they could have let us know by text or at least by email. The only compensation was that once on board we got the ear phones which usually cost $3 free! The seats I had booked had now been reassigned to someone else no explanation about that so we were cramped up in the last row where my reading light did not work. We took our own sandwiches as I refuse to buy their expensive food. Coming back we did not get anything not even a drink on the flight from LA. Also no blankets or pillows.,0
DMK (Don Muang Bangkok) to HKT. I bought 4 tickets for myself and other members of my family for this holiday flight expecting it to be the same quality of flight as the low cost flights I usually take with European low cost carriers. I was wrong. The plane though more than a few years old was clean and comfortable with a seat pitch more than adequate. During the flight snack boxes were given out along with mineral water on request all free of charge. This along with a free checked baggage allowance of 20kg makes this low cost airline more like the full service airlines of yester year that we all used to enjoy. On this single experience I will certainly use them again and would recommend.,1
"Was visiting Newcastle University so the easiest way was for me to fly there and back in one day. Booked 3 months in advance and the flights were very costly, Â£120 return for me and my mother. Considering Flybe are predominantly a regional airline this shocked me. We were on the basic hand baggage fare. Flight left Southampton 20 minutes late but made up time on arrival. Never flown Flybe or a Dash 8 aircraft before, and boy are they noisy little things for a propeller aircraft. Crew were ok, better on the return evening flight. Aircraft old and dirty. Very uncomfortable seats. However, the pilots on both flights provided regular updates. Flybe may be cheaper than BA on this route but overall they are far too expensive for the type of airline they are. It is for their prices and cabin crew service I wouldn't fly them again. ",0
MNL-BAH-DMM. Flight was full boarding was smooth given the amount of passengers going boarding the A330. Seats are ok rather hard and uncomfortable at times on the neck. IFE not on demand although are in seat. Movies are on loop no choice at all and screens are small. Food sub standard although they serve 3 choices - usually out by the time they reach the back area. Service is slow. Cabin crew not smiling and are always in a hurry they disappeared after the meals were served. Only one round of drinks given. Garbage on the floor and crew did not bother to pick them up. Boarding in Bahrain is chaotic but was given a business class seat on A320. Food served on the ground and it was tasty and good on a 20 minute flight. FA's are great!,0
LGW-BKK-HKT return. As you can see we had two internal flights - to Phuket and back. Firstly I must agree with all other comments food good quick check in offered exit seats with legroom staff friendly but not very professional. Thai greeting towels ok toilets very clean  and not very good in flight entertainment. Then it comes to the 8 hour delay at Bangkok( after a 12 hour flight) on our domestic flight to phuket. We roamed the airport aimlessly for 8 hours - not good. we were promised a transfer to Thai Airways which was not going to happen as the plane was full - bad news. Then they kept our cases at the desk and said they would be checked in for us ( along with seven other passengers cases) but when we got to Phuket we had no cases ( the other seven did) We waited until the next afternoon before they arrived at our hotel - which really meant we lost a whole day of doing nothing. It gets worse. We had to rearrange our Pick Ups at the airport. Then all this happened on the return flight from Phuket to Bankgkok. 4 hours delay. Also the food was cold on both domestic flights. The flight to LGW via Dubai was long and hot - we didn't just refuel - but off and onloaded cargo which took nearly two hours I'm sure. I timed the return flight - 15 hours 1am to 4pm. I would never use them for domestic flight ever again and only if I couldn't get another flight would I use them for international flight. Would not recommend.,0
Service was good out of PBI plane looked a little tired but seats comfortable. Upon arriving in BWI connecting flight to LGA was delayed 2.5 hrs. They need to improve their LGA service. Got there but late. Still a great airline.,1
Kathmandu-Dubai en route to JFK back and forth. I have nothing positive to say about the flight. The timing of the flight was changed 3 times. I had brought the ticket for a good transit time from Dubai which was changed making an 8 hour transit about 2 weeks prior to the flight. On arrival to the airport I was informed that the flight timing was again changed to the original time making me wait at Kathmandu Airport for another 4 hours for no reason. No prior information/emails or apologies were given. The cabin itself was too crowed with tiny seats crammed up in a small space. The air condition was not working and it was very hot and humid in the cabin with no help from the crew members on complaining regarding this problem. I was highly disappointed with Fly Dubai.,0
1st June 2013 from Ibiza to Gatwick with scheduled departure time of 11.50am. Departed at 20.30pm meaning a delay of over 8 hours (this after finding out that it wasn't just delayed it was cancelled). The flight wasn't just cancelled we were told once we had checked in that we would be flying with ?Hi Fly?despite booking to fly with Thomson. The staff at Hi Fly made us all not confident on the trip. We were sitting on the plane for over an hour while the staff were running around looking unsure of what to do. This was our honeymoon and it was a bitter end to what was an amazing honeymoon.,0
"The MAD-JFK segment of our American Airlines itinerary was on Iberia. As mentioned by other reviewers Iberia's seat selection system is a travesty. It's only purpose is to increase revenue pure and simple. At check-in we were assigned seats 42A and 42C at the very rear of the plane. Described by SeatGuru as ""bad"" these were actually OK since there was room to recline and no lavatory behind us which meant no passengers loitering around waiting to use the head. (Seats 42J & 42L on the opposite side is probably a different story.) The new A330-300 was a pleasure to fly and the flight attendants were friendly and attentive. The usual Spanish aloofness was certainly absent on this flight. Our overall experience was very good but I'd hesitate to book another flight with Iberia unless they dump their seating assignment system.",1
"Got delayed due to a maintenance issue with the plane. This happens of course but a few major issues. First they do not make announcements and let people know what is going on. It was past the scheduled departure time before they made any sort of announcement. All the announcement said was ""If you have connecting flights we are looking into possible changes. There is a problem with the plane we have no idea what it is."" Something along those lines. So all you know is that there is a problem with the plane? We all already know that or we would be in the air right now or at least on the plane. Next If you do have delays or cancellations in your flight Southwest does not pull seats from other airlines to book the affected passengers. Other airlines have done this for me in the past. This is obviously a huge issue. You may be waiting all day or even until the next day for another Southwest flight that isn't booked and is flying where you are going. And you can't even really fly to a nearby airport because Southwest doesn't service many cities. Other airlines care about keeping you informed and they will get your flight quickly changed if there is a cancellation or large delay. Southwest cannot and will not do the same.",0
"Dhaka - Kathmandu - Dhaka. This was the only airline going directly from Dhaka to Kathmandu. Outbound was on time but the plane was an old Fokker which should have been scrapped years ago. There was no electricity in the kitchen and we were server a cold ""vegetarian burger"". Going back a few days later the plane was delayed for 6 hours for no reason. Once we landed in Dhaka it was 3 am instead of 6 hours earlier at 9 pm. No explanation no excuse no suggestion of free of charge airport shuttle was given. Nothing. One of the worst flight experiences.",0
We flew BSB-GRU-JFK and back in Business and as ever the BSB-GRU leg is in economy because they don't have a Business section but they always charge full economy rate. Inflight domestic: choice of Coke or water. Staff are attentive but nothing brilliant. In GRU the lounge is a joke - more people standing than sitting and not even beers were available. Boarding was via a bus and chaotic (TAM have instituted a set of categories for boarding but more often than not it is ignored at boarding gates). GRU-JFK and back - seats are nothing great for Business class (not fully reclining) and food is at best average. Wines are good though. Flight was on time and luggage delivered quickly in JFK but not GRU.,0
Flew Brussels - Amsterdam - Bonaire in business. Leg BRU-AMS was short and OK. The leg AMS-BON was mediocre. Nothing fancy old plane. They advertise to redecorating the planes but this was still not done. Service is very cold you have the impression that you have to do them a favor and not the other way around. Food quality was very basic and same for quality of wine. Last year when we flew the same routing there was not enough food for business class passengers as it was a late flight. Feel that they reduce on everything. If there was another airline who flew straight to Bonaire I would certainly not fly KLM anymore.,0
Perth to Geraldton. Trapped on the ground at Perth for 50 mins - not Qantas' fault as Perth is so busy nowadays. FA's served water and managed to do some work while waiting. Captain kept all informed on PA. Seems to be plenty of legroom even for me at 187cm. Qantaslink 717 services in WA are by Cobham and of a very high standard. Cabin staff are uniformly excellent. The Geraldton service is by Dash 8-400. Did the return on Skywest - they've taken to using F-100 jets to replace the F-50 turboprop when available. This makes for a very quick trip. Couldn't fault either carrier but glad QF has arrived to give some competition.,1
"VIE-TLV-VIE on a Boeing 737-800 seats comfy meal sufficient and almost tasty. We booked El Al because it was more than 200 Euros cheaper than Austrian Airlines. We didn't worry about the security before we got to the airport as Israeli friends have told us that we would be asked some questions about security matters only. In the end we spent about 1 hour at the check-in counter telling some young security guy about our private lives and personal relationship. As non-Israelis we were questioned separately and our ""stories"" were put together afterwards. Telling so much about your private live to some 20 year old security guy is not worth saving 200 Euros.",0
I regularly fly to Cyprus with Thomson but was none too happy when my return flight was arranged with Jet2.com Thomson charged me Â£320 for my flight and I found out from other passengers (on the Jet2 flight) that they had paid circa Â£180 for their flights with Jet2. What a rip off - no meals no entertainment and they arrange a budget airline for the return flight. I have flown with Thomson for over 20 years but they have now lost me as a customer.,0
Travelled from Miami to London on January 8th 2015 in first class. Very bad service and very shabby cabin. Here's a warning. Our meal was extremely disappointing it was cold and when we complained the meals were taken away and re-heated not safe. Also and worse still was my wife's meal. She needs Gluten Free food but her meal was terrible some chicken and rice which again was cold. When my wife made comments to the senior steward she told us that due to AA cutbacks they are withdrawing special meals. This was not denied by AA customer relations so if you have any kind of special dietary needs do not fly AA. Be warned.,0
Milan to Lisbon and back. Did several times. Overall a fairly good experience. Always on time. Professional cabin crew although never smiling. Onboard service adapted to the duration of the flight and better than other flag carriers on European routes. Will fly TAP again without hesitation when going to Portugal.,1
Travelled Liverpool to Larnaca flights both ways arrived early. Seating and legroom very comfortable. Cabin crew excellent especially the crew on the return journey. Would never hesitate to travel EasyJet.,1
Flew from Copenhagen to Mumbai - a very pleasant experience. Aircraft was modern and clean with good leg room. Food was nice and staff very helpful. We had the same experience on our return except that we then were given seats in business class from Mumbai to Bahrain. Next time I will not hesitate using Gulf Air.,1
I have had more then one bad experience with United Airlines. Used United to fly at least 10 times in the last 10 months and almost 8 of those times something has gone wrong - cancelled flights ridiculous charges for flight changes if necessary recently my boyfriend couldn't make his first flight so United was going to cancel his round trip ticket home which meant he had to buy new flights. These are just a few examples.,0
What to say? The earlier flight to Kabul was canceled due to sandstorms but we only knew after they call us all for boarding only 3 minutes later when in the queue we were told to sit back as there were delays. Only persons chasing the staff found out about the cancellation and then in order to leave the airport they took all 120 passports and disappeared for 4 hours while the visa was cancelled with no further information to passengers. The poor information along with the staff hiding behind a cop who was the one giving the answers yelling at us and almost arresting a couple passengers that were complaining (In Dubai foreigners don't have the right to protest or demonstrate) proved they take advantage of it in order to skip passenger's complaints. Once in the aircraft next day the plane turns into a bazaar. Everything is to pay for including inflight entertainment. You can pay to have something else than the news scroll such as some TV series and pay more to access the movies. The plane was clean the seats very unconfortable.,0
"Non-existent customer service. Recently flew JAN-DFW-ELP. Delayed and missed connection in DFW due to weather. Had to overnight. No help whatsoever from AA because of ""weather"". No vouchers no distressed travel rates no phone number to call for booking my own hotel and had to walk 20 gates for hilariously cheap toiletries kit that was given grudgingly. Surly agents throughout. Truly an example of the worst in airline culture. To top it all off was unable to be booked on next morning flight and missed work. Agent could only put me on a later flight. Said I was put on FC upgrade list however. The next day when I was told I was upgraded they wanted $70 for the 1 hr flight. Agent said ""well it's not free"". I am AAdvantage Gold which is meaningless. Now a hostage to them with my new location but will take United or Southwest whenever possible in the future. People understand weather issues but the total lack of even the most basic customer service and rude behavior/attitudes is appalling about this ""airline"". Previously flown with Delta extensively and they always handled weather delays and misconnections in ATL professionally and courteously. So it can be done AA just doesn't care.",0
LCY-MAN-LCY Booking well in advance saved considerable time and money over the equivalent train journey. Cabin crew were pleasant but I do wonder why on such a short flight it's necessary to offer food albeit just a sandwich - I'd rather pay less on the ticket price. On the return journey the ground staff at MAN were extremely helpful to let me switch without charge to an earlier flight. Overall I found VLM efficient and helpful and would certainly use them again. After all flying in a Fokker 50 puddlejumper was actually fun!,0
We booked a trip to Cuba. We liked the fact they offered earlier flights going to Cuba and coming back. 3 times that week we had seen people stranded at the resort because of flight delays. Reason they said was mechanical delays. We didn't think anything until it was our turn to leave the bus did not show up at the correct time to pick us up. When we checked out they phoned to find out where the bus was told our flight was delayed until 11pm putting us in Toronto at 3.30 am in the morning. We were told mechanical problems again. When we get on the plane the pilot proceeds to tell us another story of why we were delayed. Personally I would avoid this airline.,0
"MH19 AMS-KUL 27/03. MH141 KUL-SYD 28/03. MH122 SYD-KUL 10/04. MH16 KUL-AMS 10/04. AMS-KUL-SYD-KUL-AMS in Y. One word: dreadful. Persistent delays on 3/4 sectors. Service onboard is below standard. Toilet supplies are never replenished on any sector. Complaints get a standard ""don't care"" response. Poor communication from baggage handling staff. Delayed luggage process is an utter shambles. In-flight entertainment has limited options. On the first leg the attendant left hot chilli pretzels for my two young children giggled and walked off. I went to change the packs for a different flavour and was rudely told that it's only one per passenger. On the second leg to SYD the attendant brought my children's food out. The attendant confirmed that these were child meals - when I opened it I found it was a spicy dish. I brought this to the attendants attention and asked if they could fetch the child meal that we requested. He stormed over to the people behind us snatched the food from in front of the children and dumped the food in front of my kids telling the people behind me in a very loud voice that I changed my mind. The return service was very similar. Departure out of KL was delayed an hour. If you need the toilet best to go in the early part of the flight as the toilet supplies are never replenished on all four sectors. Arrived in Sydney and with the delay in AMS meant my luggage was left in KUL. My luggage arrived the next evening. The air fares on MH are not the most competitive. If you can go with a competing airline for a similar price or slightly more go with that option rather than MH.",0
Shocking customer service only channel for any complaint is the customer helpline which they charge you to call! - after 1/2 hr the line just cuts off. Still trying to contact German wings for a refund of my flight which was cancelled due to German industrial action. I'm a regular traveller on Stansted to Stuttgart route and since the strike 7 out of the last 8 flights have been delayed by 1/2hr or more. If there was another flight operator on this route I'd be choosing them instead but I'm stuck with poor service and inefficiency on Germanwings.,0
Flew on SYD-DEL sector last month. Food is really good specially if you love Indian food. Entertainment system is good with lot of Bollywood options English selections are though few. Seats were wide and comfortable but a bit hard for 13 hour journey. Staff is courteous and listens to you unlike some Chinese airlines where it was a nightmare to make them understand what you needed. Arrival and departure time are perfect if you live in Delhi and Sydney.,1
We returned from Munich yesterday after the worse flight we have ever had we booked seats with extra legroom as my husband has sciatica and needs extra room as soon as we entered the plane we were told that we would be putting the plane at risk by sitting in our booked seats. When we complained we were treated in a very arrogant and rude manner by the cabin crew who seemed to think our plight was very amusing. There was no apology and no alternative seats offered. The plane was also old and scruffy. This was our first and last flight with easyjet.,0
Newcastle to Palma on new 737's which were clean comfortable with plenty of room as we were sitting in the new extra leg room seats (3 rows at the front) and crews were friendly (unlike some reports below). On time but map display only shown on outbound (same as last year do they not work the other way?). My grudge though is you are sold a dream holiday with Thomson (differentiated product) for which you pay a fortune but in turn you get to fly with an airline that just isn't very special. Britannia and Air 2000 which were the best holiday airlines made you feel like you were going on holiday but have been transformed into a poor version of a low cost airline. If I wanted to fly on easyjet I would and I'd know what to expect. The flight used to mark the start of your holiday and include meal cup of tea etc now its just nothing special and you're asked to part with money every time you see the crew (including scratch cards sales and charity collection not just food and drink).,0
Sydney-Denpasar return Business class. Was glad it was only a 6 hour flight each way. The cabin crew tried hard but it seems to lack the refinement of other airlines. Crew really helpful. Seats comfortable. Avoid window seats because once the row in front reclines it's a big effort to get out. Food and wine okay. Entertainment limited with personal sets. I guess you get what you pay for. For the short trip it was worth it.,1
Flew with Ryanair in September been traveling with them twice a year to Crete from LBA never had a problem and always been on time - sometimes early. The foods not all that good and the seating a bit cramped but its a budget airline. We always book our seats and get priority boarding and this time fast track for a couple of quid. For all the extras we book it still works out very very cheap compared to all other airlines. It seams a bit of a rush at times but what do you want? I want to get on get there get off and start my holiday.,1
Aircraft was clean and inflight team efficient and friendly. I recognise this airline offers stripped down fares and charges for luggage and seats etc normally provided free by other carriers. In view of this it is essential to get the management of providing these extras under control and that is not what I found. Having reserved a seat online and booking priority check-in at the airport my booking was not on the system and the seat not available. On the return no priority check-in available so I queued. The worst thing was that my complaint was badly handled and I was pointed to the small print in the Conditions of Carriage saying seat reservations don't definitely reserve you a seat and Priority Check-in is not refundable. Travelling is difficult enough without this type of response from carriers. Such a pity.,0
Sydney to Denpasar Executive class. Quick check in we had plenty of luggage as we were flying with our 10 month son did have to ask for the priority passport control cards for return leg. Qantas business lounge was half full so plenty of seating. Seat 1A/B welcome drinks and travel packs handed out wife happy with L'Occitane lip balm inflight service was pretty good. Food was good our flight attendant wasn't the friendliest but she was very professional. Cabin had plenty of kids in it all well behaved. In flight visa service is excellent made up time in the air and arrived on time our luggage was out first and the whole process from landing to taxi was done in around 35mins. Well priced package for business class would fly again.,1
LHR-PHL on a 787 Dreamliner seat 3K. I recommend seats 3K 3A 7A and 7K as you get aisle access and no other passengers have to climb over your feet when they leave their seat. The seat does feel a little claustrophobic compared to the upper deck of the 747 but it's very comfortable. The service was outstanding provided by an all male crew. The food quality has improved and so has the menu choices. The entertainment system is excellent as it's the Thales version on the 787 so the screens are bigger and the picture quality is better. The aircraft is also very quiet and the windows are a gimmick as you dim the windows rather than using the conventional blind.,1
"Flew from Belfast to Gatwick, the plane was oldish and not very comfortable, I felt really squashed where I was sitting. Plane took off on time and arrived a few minutes early on the other side, so no complaints there. Boarding was relatively quick and the cabin crew were personable, one passenger complained of being ill during the flight and was attended to with care and attention. A hassle free trip but they do need more space between seats on their planes, this is a national airline, not a budget one.",1
"LHR to Hong Kong and then onto Australia. The flight from LHR to Hong Kong was one of the worst I have experienced. During the flight it was very cold and several people were sitting with top coats on. I asked a flight attendant if the heating was working and the reply was ""it will warm up once we get going"". After 6 hours it was still freezing. It took ages for the food to be served and there seemed to be a lack of staff. If like me your over 6ft the seating is very tight. On our return from Australia there was no change. Sitting at the back it was a case of take it or go hungry as the food on the menu had run out. It was still cold and the paper thin blankets given out were a waste of time. I was told this was a good company to fly with I can confirm its one of the worst!",0
"My wife and I took United for our honeymoon to Hawaii. United fails to inform you that you need to download their app in advance to enjoy any sort of entertainment inflight. You could pay $10+ an hour to use their wifi but to use any other of their ""free"" service you must download the app in advance. For those who do not or do not have a compatible device bring your own entertainment. Upon calling to check in on our return we learned the flight had been cancelled. While they had my email address on file the only notification came through a text message. However this text didn't inform us of anything but merely asked us to ""text yes"" to the text to receive subsequent messages. Assuming this was just another airline phishing attempt I ignored the message. While they knew I was not aware of the change no call attempt or email attempt was made. Overall I satisfied.",0
Everything was good! Take off on time free lunch and free glass of wine and the crew were kind! Same thing for the return journey! It was a 4 hr flight and everything was good. Low cost vacation so I am eager to book my next trip with Sunwing!,1
Just last week flew on Monarch from Gatwick to Sharm. Second time in two years flown with Monarch and generally impressed with standard. On return trip I would say the crew were a little too social sharing conversation with colleagues a bit too openly and snacking drinking during services before flight etc. On the whole would fly again unless a legacy carrier were to open up a route. Would guarantee my custom if they were to offer a wider seat or separate cabin for a premium.,1
LHR to Brisbane return. A great experience at a very good price. The food wine and service were excellent. The seats were very comfortable. Although they can't be made fully flat we had plenty of sleep. You can adjust them easily to get a comfortable position. I agree with other reviewers about the AA lounge at Heathrow Terminal 3 although the staff were not surly as had been suggested. EVA lounges at BKK and Taipei are good as is the Qantas lounge at Brisbane.,1
From Manchester to Barbados 8/914 - 15/914 in Premium Economy. Seated downstairs on outbound - upstairs inbound which was a nicer atmosphere. Don't like the fact that Virgin have filled most of upper deck with economy seating. Crew all friendly and drinks service good. Didn't get my vegetarian meal and eventually got one on a tray from economy with no bread and plastic cutlery. Not good for premium standards. Entertainment system worked ok and film choice was good. Used to always fly BA to Barbados but last few times been with Virgin as it's the most convenient from Manchester.,1
STO-HEL on March 7th. Was on codeshare with Blue1. Crisp clean Boeing 717 with nice cream white leather seating. Short flight with pleasant staff and a clean and quiet cabin. Generous legroom. Would definitely recommend.,1
JFK-SYD via LAX. Following my review SYD-DFW I cannot believe Qantas sends an old 747 to New York. Its a 20 hour flight from JFK to SYD via LAX. The seats are like timber and are surprisingly narrow the leg room is minimal entertainment system is terrible and very small screen though food was fine I couldn't wait to get off that flight. Next time I'm flying from JFK I'll just connect to Dallas and fly with Qantas from there Qantas should be ashamed they send such an old 747 to JFK. Why is there no A380 or 747 similar to the Dallas flight.,0
Santiago to Easter Island return two long flights and both very good. We had excellent service from attentive pleasant staff and a varied inflight entertainment system that was better than what many airlines have in Business Class.,1
I've just returned from my first Jet2 package holiday. Unlike most packages we weren't pestered with holiday reps trying to sell trips. My only complaint was that when we got to the airport we were sent to the coach - we hurried in case we were keeping them waiting as my bag had been the last off the carousel. We sat on the bus for 40 minutes. When we were eventually about to set off to the hotels I asked the rep what the hold up had been. She said we'd been waiting for another flight to come in! I wouldn't have minded if she'd told us we'd be waiting all that time but just to leave people sat around is not acceptable.,1
We were quite disappointed by our first experience of Kenya Airways on our recent trip from London to Nairobi - my husband's TV wasn't working and although we asked for help that was simply ignored. The staff looked bored and were not very attentive. You had to be quick to say that you wanted coffee/tea as you only had one chance much too early during dinner. The food wasn't great but edible. I was also annoyed by the fact that they didn't encourage other passengers to put their seats forward when food was served - that meant we had even less space whilst having our breakfast. The flight back was not quite as bad but still I felt the staff could have made more of an effort (occasional smile would be nice). The thing I would really like to criticise was the boarding procedure at Nairobi airport - we were asked to board 1.5 hours before departure which meant that we were squeezed into a tiny departure lounge for that length of time - the boarding was a mess with the announcements and ground staff contradicting each other - despite the early 'boarding time' we still managed to leave late.,0
Antalya to Frankfurt Boeing 757 code share flight with Turkish airlines. The interior of the 757 was clean and looked new with seats that proved to be confortable and good legroom. Safety announcements on screen that did not work too well (several interruptions in demonstrations). Inflight service consisted of a free small snack with hot and cold drinks and a movie was projected on overhead screens although no earphones were distributed. Part of the crew was very nice and the rest did not seem to care trying to distribute meals as quickly as possible to rest in the galley.,0
Travelled Gatwick to Montego Bay on a 747. Very disappointed with the quality of the premium economy cabin. The plane was clearly passed its 'sell by' date. It looked tired and old with an entertainment system that was difficult to see. On the outward leg the magazine rack was broken and although an engineer tried to solve the problem it was not usable and flapped about throughout the flight. On the return journey the arm rest containing the table was broken and separated from the chair. The stewardess was unable to get help and in the end used sticky tape to hold the arm rest in place. She was going to take the arm rest away and replace with a towel but our comments about basic safety and the need to make it safe led to the makeshift solution. Then there is the food which is probably the worst I have had flying premium economy. Is this a case of an airline flying a route with little competition and therefore setting the lowest possible tolerable standard? An old tired plane with average and below average service.,0
Flew last month Sao Paulo - Istanbul - Sharm el Sheikh - Cairo - Istanbul - Paris. All flights were on time. Staff and food very good. Maybe there is a lack of knowledge about the wines. Concerning the seats it depends on the aircraft. On the segment Sao Paulo - Istanbul it was an A340 with lie flat business seat which is not perfect for a 13 hours flight. The A319 between Istanbul and Sharm was like all European business class seats that means seats the same as in economy just a curtain between coach and business. Cairo - Istanbul A321 great seats 2X2 very comfortable for a 2 hours flight and the best seat was on the A330 between Istanbul and Paris. Full flat seat. A lot of room. Food was very good on all flights. A very good airline.,1
QF702 25th July 2014 from Melbourne to Cairns. The service from the cabin crew to ground staff was outstanding. Meal served was excellent - hot and delivered with a smile from very present young crew member. It's just a pity the airline does not advertise the quality they offer in comparison to their competitors. This is a first class airline that should be supported by all Australian travellers. We will only fly Qantas in future.,1
4U3375 22/2/14. STN-HAJ. Low cost low service. But all in all good flight. Plane was half empty had 2 rows to myself. Seats were uncomfortable. Same as Lufthansa has. After an hour my back hurt.,1
STR-HAM one way. Very pleasant flight no lines at check-in on time nice cabin crew one round of drinks with choice of cookies or crackers 737-700 clean and well prepared. Pitch between seats could be one or two inches more. Cheap fare since we booked 4 months in advance. Overall: very good!,1
"SV720 DMM-ISB March 18. Travelling with aged father and so I tried to get business seats. Business class does not exist! The seats in Economy class are fine if your height does not exceed 5 feet. If you are 5'11"" like me you will be in extreme pain.",1
Great flight. Midnight departure caters for people like me wanting to go to sleep ASAP after takeoff. Seat liner on the seat while I changed. Slept for 7 hours. Entertainment system and food were excellent. The crew were the ones who made the flight so good.,1
LHR-DFW return on 777-300ER. I booked this route especially to take this newer plane for the inflight entertainment which did not disappoint. I found the crew okay and some even smiled! What I disliked about AA was the exorbitant prices they charge for pre-allocated seats which was a necessity in order to seat a family of 4 together. The food was mostly below average but having read reviews I wasn't surprised. I don't like the way they have chosen to add another seat to each row in economy. So instead of 9 abreast they have made it 10. This makes the aisle ridiculously narrow and I don't see how hundreds of people would be able to escape in an emergency so I'm surprised the FAA permits this higher density seating. Legroom was tight for anyone of above average height. I also found it strange how the seat belt sign was illuminated for virtually the whole flight - in both directions - and there are hardly any announcements from the flight deck even when turbulence is quite choppy. I chose AA for the equipment they use on this route but I would think twice about booking them again due to the hidden costs that aren't factored into the ticket price.,0
BKK-USM-BKK. A bit upset at the beginning as I arrive early and request a flight change denied by ground staff though I overheard that the flight is not full but that is understandable. Their recently renovated Boutique lounge (economy class lounge) at BKK airport is nice plenty of comfortable seats nice snacks and good Wifi connection for my long wait. Both flights were fine on refurbished A319 with shiny new cushion seat covered hot light supper/ tasty snack is served by nice attendant. Minus point is punctuality both flight delayed 20 and 30 minutes respectively.,1
Have flown Glasgow to Malaga and Lanzarote in the last 6 months. All 4 flights were a delight. Very quick check-in and friendly staff. Good legroom and comfortable seats. Planes clean and well ventilated. Food and drink reasonably priced. Price and flight times good. If possible will use Jet2 again rather than a certain other low price airline. Other good point is the 22Kg baggage allowance.,1
EY 285 Aug 29th. EY 131 Aug 30th. Flew IAD-AUH-BLR round trip in Economy. 3 out of the 4 segments were delayed two were delayed for more than an hour. Had air conditioner issues for nearly 30 minutes on IAD-AUH segment. No reasoning for delays no proper announcements. No liquids service before the meals IFE is just ok. AUH doesn't have great transit facilities either overall would refer this airline only if the fares are way below the other carriers.,0
DAM-BAH-KUL. Departure from Damascus on E170 - first time for me on Embraer aircraft and was surprised at the leg room and comfort for Y class. They upgraded me to J Class on the short flight. Arrived Bahrain and given a complimentary stay at the Golden Tulip. Just after midnight transferred back to the airport for 2am flight to Kuala Lumpur. The flight ended up to be 95% full and it was extremely painful to sit on the hard Y seats of their A330-200. Service and meal great. I just wonder why the 2nd meal service for all flight ex-Bahrain is much more appetizing as compared to those flight bound for Bahrain?,1
Flew Mexico - Panama and back in Economy Class. Travelled with an infant and requested a front row seat. Request was denied. Online check-in was not permitted for passengers travelling with infants. At Airport check-in staff were slow and after several minutes they suggested my wife and I sit on different seats. When I strongly protested with the suggestion they reassigned us so we were seated together. In flight service was poor and comparable to budget airline standards. Food was cold and not fit for consumption the only thing was the metal cutlery which is rare these days. Flight attendants were cold and not open to requests. On the return flight I called Copa Panama to request a front row seat I was told it was assigned when I got to the airport I was told there was no request made and no seat assigned. Inflight entertainment on the way into Panama was not functioning. Overall a bad experience.,0
MAN-KEF-MAN Economy B757. Seat pitch reasonable and surprisingly good IFE for short haul sector. FA's pleasant and service was polite and efficient with complimentary soft and hot drinks. Checked in online ex UK with easy seat selection. Return leg not quite as problem free - inbound aircraft went tech in Toronto so offered slightly earlier flight to LHR and then onward to MAN with BA. Despite having to change terminals at LHR and transiting T5 baggage still made it to MAN.,1
3rd June with return 13 of June Stockholm-Barcelona-Stockholm. The seat comfort is so poor that a tall man as I doesn't have enough space for the legs. It's really terrible to fly a couple of hours with Vueling. Some of the staff are also unfriendly but mostly they are helpful and nice.,0
DME-VCE. Service was much better than I expected it to be. Flight took off on time despite snowfall and bad weather crew were friendly 2 drink services and 1 meal service for a 3 hour flight. Meal was delicious. Airplane is clean but lacks IFE. Pillows and blankets are provided. Towels and sweets given before departure. Overall a very good experience with Transaero Airlines and definitely will recommend this airline.,1
Honolulu to Auckland - very cramped seating - we are both tall - bit annoyed that there were empty rows with one person there yet others were cramped. Felt like a wreck when we landed after a brilliant holiday. Air New Zealand used to be a really good airline now it feels cheap. Next time I will choose a different airline. Food was awful entertainment poor.,0
TLV-BKK Economy Plus. Flight on a very old B767-300 4X-EAR. Good leg room in economy plus. Got an amenity kit. However no entertainment only a big screen. Slept much of the flight. One hour after takeoff served food but didn't eat. After that crew disappeared. They came back only in the end to serve breakfast which was a good omelette and a cake. Nice overall. Would not fly with them on this route unless they change the plane.,0
I took the Manila to Hong Kong route on 19 May 2015 and return leg on 21 May 2015. This flight is a 90 minute flight per leg. The first leg was delayed by 40 mins while the second leg was delayed by 3 hours. Service is normal. Overall I'd give it a fail for the kind of delay I faced.,0
BRU-DNK and back trough Kiev. Flights were without problems and no delays. Only thing I can say is the meal is only a sandwich and very small hot meal. Transfer in Terminal F took 1.5 hours on the journey back with a lack of organisation. Not sure this was the fault of UIA or Borispol Airport Kiev.,1
Flew from Dhaka to London in October with new Boeing 777 on business class. To be honest wasn't that bad but they do need to look after their Business class passengers a bit more. Plane was new and entertainment was alright most movies are outdated by least by 6+ months. Foods were okay just to fill you up I found Qatar Economy food even better then Biman Business class. A lot of leg room only thing I hated was when the announcement was made for economy class not to do this and that it was broadcast throughout the plane. Overall I will fly again.,1
Flying from HCM to DaNang on 19th April 2014 and then returning on 24th. Both sectors were late the last by an hour on the first I had no tray table it was gone and as for contact in HCM on another matter I was given 5 different phone numbers all of which passed me on to another.,0
Brussels-Helsinki-Tokyo (Narita) return. I fly frequently and this is absolutely one of the better airlines. Very friendly and attentive crew food was ok new plane for the long trip from HEL-NAR. I'd choose Finnair again.,1
NZ443 Auckland to Wellington on 18 April 2014. The seating on this flight was comfortable enough but the connection from an international to a domestic flight at Auckland airport really needs to be improved (though this is obviously not the fault of Air New Zealand). The flight itself however was delayed and no calls were made about the delay until 40 minutes after the scheduled departure time. Better communication is needed.,1
"Brussels - Djerba. This flight used quite a well-used and tired 737. The legroom was the smallest I experienced - even my seat neighbor less than 175 cm tall was cramped with his knees by the next seat. Beverages and food only for cash seat reservation also only if you pay 3 Euros. They changed the flight plan also shortly before travel - added one extra stop in MIR and 90 extra minutes of flight time. Bugger. For this kind of low-cost service the flight itself is not cheap enough. Better pay a few euros more and fly Tunisair or Air Berlin - also not great airlines but with better comfort and subjective safety ""feel"" to it.",0
The flight was delayed 3 hours 15 minutes and we only found this out when we were waiting to board although obviously the airline knew about this problem in advance The ground personnel were not very helpful except to offer us a free lunch. We finally located the restaurant where this so-called free lunch was available. They offered a choice of two cheap sausages or frozen pizza inferior to what you could buy at the supermarket. The drinks for bottled spritzers with artificial flavors like lemon and orange. The calls for the delay was never explained to us. The in-flight service and food were inferior and mediocre at best. This was a disappointing experience.,0
PHL-LAX and LAX-PHL - 6/15/2012 and 6/18/2012 - Check in was fast and the plane itself is great. Love the back seat TV and headphones. Headphones you can buy for $2.00 and they come in blue silver and pink. My girls loved them. The main complaint I have about this airline is that on both trips the flight attendants were rude and unfriendly. Very bad customer service! They should have better schooling for their attendants. This is the first and probable the last time I would travel with them if they don't correct this. Southwest is usually what I fly and their flight attendants are awesome.,0
I travel with them at least once a month either in Business or Economy class. Their inflight service attitude is normally above standard and while airline meals are what they are MH catering is tasty and ok for regional flights. What I want to comment on is the appearance of the cabin: on many recent flights I took within the region especially on B737s the cleanliness left a lot to be desired. Any aircraft I boarded had either dirty finger or palm-prints on the overhead lockers. The way they looked it appeared to be from aircraft mechanics as they were oil/grease based prints. Nobody bothered to clean them up. Additionally the aircon vents and even overhead monitors that drop down from the ceilings on B737s all had a huge accumulation of fluff attached to them. It all gives the interior of the planes a shabby look and not representative of a 5 star airline. What prompted me to write this review was a recent domestic flight on Vietnam Airlines where the planes were spotlessly clean and looked all new even when they were not. Malaysia Airlines get it together and clean your planes properly. It is a disgrace for a 5 star airline to be so careless about hygiene.,1
SYD-WGA-SYD. Trip down on morning flight was on the larger Q400. The crew weren't present for most of the flight and were very robotic offering bare minimum service. The refreshment whilst nice was not substantial and handed out in a rushed manner. However one positive is that the crew phoned ahead for taxis due to the small size of Wagga's airport and distance from the town centre. Flight back to Sydney was on the smaller Q300. The crew were very friendly constantly making their way through the cabin to talk to passengers. The service on this flight was a stark contrast to the first flight. Both flights were on time and cabins were clean.,1
Flew HCM - Sydney on 10/4/15. Despite a full plane both the toilets in the middle section were locked and unavailable for passenger use throughout the entire flight. Apparently it is not uncommon behavior from Vietnam Airlines cabin crew to do this for reasons I am not entirely certain. Constant queues at the dirty rear toilets throughout the flight. Absolutely unprofessional and unacceptable.,0
We flew business class between LA and Bangkok round trip January 2015. Plane was A-380. Seats were very comfortable full recline so sleeping was good. Flight crew were very attentive good service and good selection of food. In the past reviews have complained of lack of English by the crew we did not find this to be a problem. Highly recommended and great value for fare paid. Only complaint was poor choice of movies and most were older films.,1
I heard last week that Southwest is the largest airline in the US now. Unfortunately I think their growth has resulted in decreased novelty and satisfaction. I do fly it on a regular basis because they service MDW from LAX but I find that the amount of space for seats is poor the wifi is the worst that I have found in the market in recent years (I work a lot on planes and SW wifi is very very slow). It is not worth looking at inflight snacks as the quality is so poor. It is now just an airline with less than average amenities.,0
Nearly got bumped off our flight from Toronto to NY Newark. Wasn't allowed to check in online. Arrived at the airport early and noticed our boarding cards had not issued seat numbers just asterisks. When we mentioned this we were then allocated seats with a new boarding card. The flight was overbooked and some people were subsequently bumped. We paid 25 dollars each way for luggage but loads of people who had brought large hand luggage were then made to check them in but for free. We felt this was very unfair.,1
MNL-CEB / CEB-MNL - Flight was on time it was pleasant nothing really special but generally OK. However we experienced a bit of inconvenience as the line for the check in counter at the terminal 3 in Manila was strangely slow. It might be due to the passenger volume but they could have done better service.,1
I used to recommend flying Delta to friends and family. I fly very often and they used to do a great job. This past time while flying they disregarded the seats that I had chosen and put me in the very back row on all of my flights. I get very bad anxiety back there and was very unhappy with this. When I kindly and calmly asked them about this they told me that you now need to pay extra in order to choose a seat ahead of time. Flights are already starting to cost a lot more so there is no way that I am going to pay extra for a seat every time that I fly. I will never fly Delta again as long as they operate this way.,0
VIE-IST-TLV-IST-HAM: Outbound flight from VIE to IST with A 330-200. Much legroom excellent food freshly squeezed juices and very tasty hot meal. Flight attendants were smiling and friendly and did a great job to complete a full service within 2hrs 45 min. Flight left on time arrived on time in IST. Smooth check-in and boarding in Vienna. Transfer at IST airport very easy. Plenty of shops and restaurants the only downside is that there was no airbridge available for the next flight to TLV. No seats available at the departure gate and very cramped. Flight from IST to TLV was excellent. Brand new A321 with personal TV on each seat. Again FA's very friendly and they served a hot meal in the middle of the night (flight was 1 hour 40 min). Return flight from TLV to IST again a very new plane flight left punctual at Ben Gurion airport FA's smiling and friendly all the time. Again a smooth transfer at IST connection to HAM. Older aircraft from IST to HAM but enough legroom even in Y- class. I have no doubt to recommend this airline. Especially the catering and the onboard meals are fresh and tasty from Turkish Do&CO. Turkish is much better than most of the European airlines. Will choose them again.,1
LHR-DEL-BKK return. First leg to Delhi (777-3ER) in the night dinner was served as well as breakfast both delicious. Flight attendants happy to help Delhi T3 is clean and modern and the transit was smooth. Second flight A321 with inflight entertainment! Again a meal and flight attendants happy to help. Return flights seemed to be even better Delhi transit again smooth meals were great small delay to LHR due to congestion at DEL but made up for it. Flight attendants were polite and again helpful. 773ER inflight entertainment is great though a little bit hit and miss! No issues with baggage would recommend.,1
Travelled to Orlando via Philly and had a bad trip due to the incompetence of US Airways. Booked for a family of 6 (4 adults and 2 children 6 and 8) and was given split seats. I was told by the staff that we should ask the people who were in the seats next to some of us if they would move to let our family stay together. Got to Philly and heard a blurb over the tannoy so I went to the desk and asked about it and was abruptly told to wait. Asked again about sitting together only to be told the same thing again at least that's standardisation for you. The return flight was worse with inconsiderate flight attendants no back of the seat screen and again had to sort ourselves out with other families. I will never ever fly with US Airways again abysmal company.,0
London Heathrow UK to Entebbe Uganda return via Addis Ababa Ethiopia and Kigali Rwanda. I left on 16 Feb and returned on 20th Feb 2014. Flight numbers ET701 ET811 ET821 and ET710. A decent long haul flight brand new aeroplane good food plenty to drink good entertainment and attentive air hosts. Not the best I've ever flown with but by no means the worst.,1
Monastir to Gatwick. The aircraft was an absolute disgrace. I was given a broken seat (6C) and the very unhelpful crew finally offered me a seat at the back. The trays were broken my armrest was falling off and the toilets were in a disgusting state. The crew are not interested in customer service. There was no milk for the coffee. If planning to travel to Tunisia do not travel by Karthago. They have no concept of customer service including the ground staff who had no courtesy to keep us informed about the 4 hour delay we had. No apology or explanation given. Had I read the other reviews on this site I would have never booked my trip to Tunisia. By far the worst experience I have ever had and my husband and I couldn''t wait to get off the plane.,0
"27 June 2014 flight LH454. I flew Lufthansa from Frankfurt to San Francisco on an A380 and it is not an experience I would like to repeat. I know flying economy is supposed to be uncomfortable and unpleasant on any airline but adding hundreds of passengers to what most other airplanes carry only compounds the misery. Space tight seats very narrow and food bland as usual for economy. What made this flight ""memorable"" were the long boarding lines and the length of time it took to get off the airplane after an 11 hour flight. I hope the A340 and the A330 airplanes stick around for a long time to come.",0
After reading all the reviews here my wife and I didn't know what to expect from Rouge. We flew from Toronto to Edinburgh on Aug 28 and were very pleasantly surprised. My wife is pushing 6' and not once complained of leg room she did have an aisle seat where I get the window seat and I didn't have a problem either. Food was airplane food what else can I say it was hot and edible didn't once have a problem with any request from the crew. Crew was very professional and courteous young and full of energy. Must say better than some of the flight crew on the mainline AC a smile goes a long way. We flew Rouge on the return trip Sept 12 and experienced the same service. We knew of the inflight entertainment and came prepared I liked using my own IPad I could watch or listen to my own or theirs. We would fly again on Rouge we liked the route and really liked the price over mainline Air Canada.,1
"BKK-MAD return with a short layover in new Doha airport. Perfect. From the ease of online booking to check-in from gate to flight services (food is really good and Beverage selection is superb.) Inflight entertainment is Excellent. The headrest that folds makes for a comfortable trip. I am 5'7"" leg room was very adequate even if the person in front reclined. Staff were always friendly and smiling.",1
Manchester-Manila return 03/10/14 and returned 19/10/14. Flights delayed after stop over in Taiwan going to Manila and from Taiwan going back to Amsterdam. Had to disembark twice in Taiwan as transit passengers. Air conditioning system not working properly on the ground going back to Amsterdam. So hot and inconvenient with no proper updated announcement as to what's going on. Very cheap and inconvenient earphones. Very limited inflight entertainment choices. No inflight menu selection food so so and the cabin crews just shove the trays in front of you - not very hospitable. Poor handling of ground staff about transfer and connecting flights due to delays. Messy chaotic and tiring flights. First time to fly KLM and the experience puts me off using their service again. Overall experience not enjoyable and won't recommend it. Needs improvement.,0
We were caught up in the recent Air Traffic Control strike and while sat with our bags waiting for our transfer to the airport back to Bristol our flight was cancelled. Our only complaint was the text advised of the flight cancellation and what to do re compensation but did not tell us what to do at that very moment. We decided to make our way to the airport anyway and once there joined a queue of other confused passengers. Anyway to cut a long story short we were put in a 4* Marriott Hotel full board for an additional 3 nights at no cost to ourselves. We had agreed to take the Gatwick flight back on the Saturday as this was the only flight available but on reaching the airport early we asked if there might be any chance that there were places on the Bristol flight. We were told to return in an hour and on returning found the lady on the desk had saved 2 seats for us and we were home by midday.,1
Flew QF29 to Hong Kong from Melbourne - great flight good service kept asking for drinks. The entertainment system is really old and our entertainment shut down and we were ignored for 1 hour the head flight attendant gave us $50 duty free vouchers.,1
Went to Punta Cana recently with Sunwing. We sat on the plane while it took forever for it to finally start moving and take off. Got to our resort and it was terrible. Sunwing reps didn't seem to know much about anything. Flight attendants were extremely rude the worst I have come across. Inflight entertainment consisted of a low budget movie which nobody had ever heard of. Flight was delayed on the way out of Punta Cana however the airline never let anyone know and everyone was panicked and scrambling to find out what was going on. When it was finally time to board they didn't even announce it. Could have easily missed our flight if we weren't paying extra attention.,0
ATH-NTE 11 August 2012. Flight was on time the meal was served after one hour as we experienced turbulence and flight attendants weren't allowed to serve us. The meal was a sandwich and endless drinks. Crew friendly and smiling. NTE-ATH 18 August 2012: Flight on time. Boarded fast it was 100% complete like the last flight. Flight attendants served the meal immediately so people could sleep (the flight was late in the night). The meal was a sandwich again. Arrived on time. Nice experience will travel again this summer.,1
"I traveled from Kuwait to Kochi via Doha return. At the time of booking I opted for Vegan meal, it food made of dairy products at both the occasions ( Doha-Kochi-Doha). The response of cabin crew was initially poor due to the lack of information about vegan food, though they apologised. On the next journey they compensated by offering additional fruits. Other than food, my flight experience was satisfactory, smooth check in, on time.",1
Flew MAN-CDG-HAV return. The only problem was CDG see airport review. I will use this airline again but only for direct flights not via CDG.,1
My assistant booked me on Spirit from LaGuardia to O'Hare because their flight times fit my schedule. I didn't really know anything about this airline so I got blindsided by fees and poorly communicated flight changes. Round trip both flights were delayed without explanation. On my return trip the gate was changed but the information was not updated on the boards - which caused panic and chaos. To board we walked down this employee-only stairway outside and threading through construction cones and baggage carts to walk up a plank to the airplane. There aren't words to describe how degrading the whole experience was. Note: I'd like to be able to rate seat comfort inflight food and entertainment but there was none.,0
Again Avior and disapointed but its the only carrier operating between Trinidad W.I. and Isla Margarita. They recently cancelled the operation of the old B732 (except public Holidays and long weekends in Trinidad) into a small 19 seater Turboprop Beech Aircraft. No washroom on this Aircraft and no FA's. The only safety instruction was a lousy tape in Spanish. Only English speaking Trinis on board. Return flight we were told that the flight is delayed from 9am to 12noon (maybe) because of technical problems in Barcelona (Venezuela). Actually the flight came in 2PM and after again 2 hrs we were able to board the flight. The ground staff from Avior was helpful and organized for other passenger to get baggage in the terminal to feed small children and change clothes. We arrived safe back in Trinidad but still worries about the standard and safety of this airline.,0
DOH-KWI with 2 friends and enjoyed the flight. Check in great - staff friendly. Checked bag 2kg over and they didn't ask for extra payment. Boarding via bus and organized. Flight was maybe 40% full so had a full row to myself. Seats comfortable (more space than other LCC in Europe) flight attendants friendly and smiling. Bathrooms kept clean. Would fly them again - great value for the money.,1
"London to Nairobi - excellent flight good service comfortable seat decent leg room (I am 5'10"") food could be better good entertainment system. I would happily use them again. Onward to Mombassa also fine delayed coming back at Mombassa - not airlines fault - but connection held and most of time made up and free refreshments when delayed so overall did well despite difficulties.",0
Recently used VN for our domestic flights in Vietnam during our recent trip. Both flights departed and landed on time. Paid the extra for business for the extra luggage allowance you get. Seats were spacious and comfortable and a drink and snack was provided even though very short flights. Crew smiling and pleasant. Would highly recommend for domestic flights around Vietnam.,1
Manchester to Hurghada on Boeing 757-200 G-FCLH and it was the worst flight I have been on! Sat in window seat 15F. I argued at check-in that although 15F was on the side of the aircraft with windows it did not have one. Boarded the plane seat 15F. No window! I am by no means large neither was the 10 year old who was kicking my seat behind me which could not be helped as he also couldn't move because of the poor legroom. Aircraft was filthy. Flight time from Manchester to Hurghada is usually 5 hrs 35 mins. It was pleasing when the crew said this was to be only 5 hrs 18 mins. In truth the aircraft shut down 5 hrs 50 mins after it had first moved for the purpose of its flight. Will I fly them again? Yes but only because I need to fly home. Lookout for an identical review about Halloween time. Unless they send an A320/A321/A332/A333/B753/B763 to cover the flight instead I don't expect to be happy!,0
KEF-LGW. The only thing I found odd is when we arrived at the airport from Edmonton landed on time but had to go through security. Flight wise it was fine arrived a few minutes late but what can you expect landing in London? Overall great flight.,1
I was flying Geneva-Kiev-Moscow with this company and the service was horrible. First they park planes far away from the terminal so instead of an hour we had just 10 mins between flights. Our luggage was transferred later so passengers had to wait onboard for departure for an hour or more. Staff were quite welcoming but they don't speak much English. The meals were too small and tasteless. Landed in Moscow with 40 mins delay.,0
Just awful! Used to be really great and easy. Lately (the last year and a half) they have been so unreliable. We do monthly flights from Toronto to Montreal and vice versa and every time without fail are delayed one way if not both and/or cancelled. There have been 3 times this year where the flight has left for Toronto only to turn around and come back to Montreal for one reason or another with no compensation. A free drink is certainly not worth all of the trouble it is faster to drive with all of the delays. They really need to get things back on track can't imagine how poor their on time service rate must be at this point.,0
"MEL-SYD return and multiple flights. Once again this airline is as good as they come. Flew business class between Melbourne and Wellington recently and was more than impressed with the quality of the food and service. Lounges for Trans-Tasman flights are shared with Air New Zealand which are both very good in Melbourne and Wellington. Recent trips to Sydney and return have also been impressive. Nice apple muffin served and water, juice tea or coffee offered and due to Platinum status seating in row 3 a bonus. The other thing about VA is their turn-around time which is pretty quick. Often seated at Departure gate and watch passengers disembarking and in what seems no time at all you are being boarded for your flight. Staff are always friendly and helpful. Overall an airline that is really striving for excellence. ",1
NBO-DOH-JFK. Fabulous experience in our view better than BA First Class. Food was excellent wines were superb and service on both legs was outstanding. IFE worked perfectly and had plenty of variety. Both flights on time. Our connection in DOH was too short to visit the lounge.,1
Recently flew from Boston to Seattle. Reasonable fare and very pleasant flight. I fly frequently and find JetBlue to have the best customer service.,1
Flew Stansted-Rome for a short stay with friends almost got bowled over by the rush to get off the bus and onto the plane to get seats. Then on the way back at the Rome check-in our checked bag was determined to be too heavy even though it was exactly the same weight it had been on the way out so we had to take items out and add them to the carry-on bag before we could check the bag in. I would only recommend Ryanair to someone who had absolutely no other way of getting to his destination.,0
Although it said online early am the flight from Mannheim to Florence was going to be delayed three hours on check in at airport the gate agent swore there was no issue and flight was on time. However ten minutes before we were to board they announced the three hour delay. After the three hours flight was cancelled. They could tell us nothing and getting any info in English was difficult. All non German speaking travelers couldn't get rebooked until the next afternoon.,0
"Jakarta to Guangzhou on B737-800. Aircraft in decent clean condition, IFE on each seat back. Flight departed on time, cabin crew efficient and friendly enough. Food and wine plentiful and decent.",1
Flight from Birmingham airport 25th July 2013 flight number TOM262 to Marrakech. Returned 8th August TOM 263. Informed on departure that a stewardess was off sick our co-operation was requested by the captain due to this. 1 hr 10 mins after take off drinks were served to us. The toilets then broke causing long queues. Stroppy sullen staff too busy talking to each other than to meet and greet passengers. Return flight as expected - as poor as anticipated. One cabin crew member spent the entire flight encouraging customers to buy duty free donate to their chosen charity. It was a night flight so a few moments peace would have been ideal. First and last time we will use Thomson.,0
LHR-CMB return. Flights left and arrived on time. Regular supply of drinks. Seats slightly uncomfortable. Going out my wife's IFE didn't work but our seats were swapped.,1
Flew SIN-BKK and BKK-SIN. Both trips were smooth. Will fly with Tiger again for my regional trips. Cheapest and value for money.,1
We flew economy plus during October 2014. The aircraft was a Dreamliner 787. If you are a middle passenger or an inside one you are in big trouble. You cannot get out of the seat unless you step on the aisle seat. While comfortable when seated it is impossible to get out or move around. The aisles are narrow and barely passable without bumping a passenger. Regular economy must have felt like cattle without the amenities that we at least got in economy plus. Unless you can get an aisle or adjoining aisles with a partner or the bulk head don't book a ticket.,0
December 2013 from LHR-DXB in business class on A380. After sitting on the aircraft for 5 hours the flight was announced cancelled and we all had to disembark. During the 5 hours onboard we were not served food even after asking for at least a sandwich. We were not allowed any hot drinks in case we were going to suddenly take off - which was very unlikely! We were asked to keep our seats upright also in case we were going to suddenly take off! We were then left with no information regarding our next flight details. After managing (with great effort and with absolutely no assistance from Qantas staff) to transfer onto Emirates 18 hours later than initially scheduled to depart. Arrived in DXB without baggage! After disembarking the plane 5 hours later without being served any food Qantas refused to even provide dinner. The worst service I have experienced from an airline.,0
I flew AC Rouge Feb 21st to Phoenix and return. We were 1.5 hours late taking off. They said it was because they were waiting for people to get through customs but why should we reward people for being late and punish the people who left on time to get through customs. Rouge's website states you only need to be there 90 minutes before your flight this is wrong you need to be there at least 2-2.5 hours before to get through customs. Arriving late in Phoenix they had us waiting at the wrong carrousel for our luggage and never did tell us. Onboard entertainment is non existent you have to bring your own. The TV and movies on the Rouge app are so old you cannot find anything to watch. On return flight we were 30 min late leaving. Arrival back in Toronto we waited for over 1 hour to get our luggage. I will say that there is one thing they do well. Their booking online their online reminders and online booking for your meals - (just remember you have to show the flight attendant your ticket that you have prepaid for your meal.,0
VIE-LHR short delay in departure for de-icing 2 drink rounds and a muffin check-in - bag drop packed but didn't wait long slightly delayed through traffic over London waited 25 min at the baggage belt in Heathrow on arrival.,1
I just took a trip 2 weeks ago. Flew from Chicago to Dallas Dallas to El Salvador. We landed in Dallas with 27 minutes until our next flight was leaving so we ran through the airport made my flight and thought there is was no way our luggage made it! We were so excited when we arrived in El Salvador to find that all of our bags made it.,1
My trip was YYZ-PUJ (Punta Cana) May 9 out and 16 back. I have nothing but praise for this airline. Our flights were boarded on time and departed as such. The onboard service was exceptional friendly crew beautifully spacious A330 and fantastic entertainment package. Seats were comfortable and did not get the feeling of being cramped.,1
9th Nov Hong Kong- Manila and Manila- Busuanga (cancelled). 15th Nov - Tagbilaran - Manila and Manila - Caticlan (diverted to Kalibo). During the last few weeks we have made 4 trips on Cebu Pacific and each one has been a challenge. 3 flights were delayed and 1 cancelled completely. Of the 3 which were delayed one to Caticlan was so late they ended up diverting to Kalibo as the airport was closed. As soon as anything goes wrong they are useless. I made 2 calls to them and spent over 2.5 hours trying to resolve problems and all you do is go round in circles. When you ask to speak to a manager they tell you there isn't one. If you insist eventually one appears. Their managers aren't any better though so there really is very little point. If they promise to email you don't believe them. They're unlikely to bother. Don't expect to be informed if you're flight is cancelled if you haven't got a local number. All in all if things go smoothly you may be ok. Once they start to go wrong you're in trouble. If you want some degree of certainty you may be better sticking with PAL!,0
"I have used Darwin airline twice now between Cambridge UK and Geneva. The first time the airline introduced a stop over in Paris after I had booked and brought the scheduled departure time from GVA forward several hours. Major disruption and additional cost for me but decided to give them one more try. Unfortunately on the second trip I received an incomplete text message on the evening before my departure to Geneva to inform me that ""due to operational reasons the flight the very next day had been brought forward by 3 hours"". Again major disruption and expense or face throwing my ticket in the bin. Real shame because the airport at Cambridge is a refreshing change from the hassle of a major airport and the Saab aircraft used by Darwin are superb. But this has to be the last time. Back to major airport hassle and airlines which keep to their schedules.",0
MAA-DOH-CDG-JFK (round trip) with our 19 month old infant. CDG-JFK flight was hectic (AA flight) with no legroom. The food was fantastic and the crew were great. Oryx Entertainment system was really good and easy to handle. The whole experience was positive.,1
Casablanca-Munich. After horrible experience of Casablanca airport flight with RAM was a pleasure. Brand new and very clean Embraer 190 on time. Good legroom nice leather seats in olive-brown colour with red accents. Nice smiling and professional cabin crew all announcements in Arabic French and English. Decent hot meal (chicken and fish to choose from) excellent chocolate cake. No IFE or duty free available on E190. Very good flight.,1
JFK-Berlin-Stockholm. The JFK-Berlin leg was in Business and the Berlin-Stockholm in Economy with no other option. I found the initial flight to be very good helped by a highly professional cabin crew plenty of room and good facilities even though the plane was older. The food and beverage were very good and generally this rates as high up on my scale of satisfaction. The seats are to be upgraded soon but were not bad if not entirely flat in bed mode. Berlin's newish Tegel Airport was something of an experience. The flight parked on the tarmac and in pouring rain once we were off the plane a people mover took us to the terminal for immigration and customs. Thankfully the process was fast and efficient although I had to race in order to ensure getting to the next gate for the flight to Stockholm. The next flight was however delayed without any explanation and ultimately proved to be less memorable. The plane was older and again required a walk in rain to board. Berlin Tegel is therefore an airport to be avoided in future. To Stockholm there was a limited service although staff had been trained well. I will watch and use them again.,1
Flew SN 515 1 Nov 2013 evening service BRU-IAD. A very pleasant experience. Beautiful and clean Airbus 330-200. The ground staff as well as the cabin crew dedicated and professional. The meals were generous and served with a smile. A great flight and fully recommended.,1
SYD-DPS. This airline just continues to get better every time I fly them. Check in perfect visa on board very convenient. Qantas lounge at Sydney is a pleasant way to wait for flight. Easy boarding cabin clean and almost empty in business cabin. Seat fantastic very comfortable in all positions. IFE entertained me for the whole 6.5 hour flight no problems. Noise cancelling headphones are not Bose but the do help and make for a more comfortable flight. Champagne has been upgraded to billecart salmon and was excellent. Entree trio of salmon was excellent chicken main was too spiced for me (I'm a chilli wimp tho). I would definitely recommend Garuda.,1
My partner and I flew SYD-LHR return via ICN at the end of March. The flights from SYD-ICN and return were a bit disappointing compared with the INC-LHR flights. Being 9.5hrs long I would expect a quality entertainment system but instead we had a selection of 5 English language films (2 were children's) which played on a loop which were unable to pause when announcements were made by crew so they would speak over the top missing parts of the film. The ICN-LHR flights were excellent and the entertainment system was more modern and had a much better selection of films and TV which you could actually control. Staff on all Asiana flights were polite and helpful better than I have experienced on any other airline. Food was OK but could have improvement it was all pretty similar - the variety of dishes was very limited.,1
"AC138 Vancouver-Ottawa. Usual AC crush on boarding with lots of people with too much carry-on no enforcement of carry on policy and insufficient space in aircraft cabin design for carry-on seems to be a universal feature of AC that you have to fight for bin space. Cabin crew managed to pack everyone's stuff in. 6 row seating and only 2 washrooms for about 160 people no doubt maximizes AC revenue when combined with overbooking - but no room to move in the cabin two people can't pass in the aisles without standing on the aisle seat passenger. Seats cramped. Flight safety briefings are now followed by full volume ads for BMW and credit card products. Inflight service then began by cabin staff selling earphones. Chose not to purchase later realized this a wise choice in view of limited inflight entertainment options. Food service - if you're asleep when they come round don't worry - if the cart doesn't wake you by banging your elbow as it comes by you will be shouted at until you do wake up and a menu card is wafted under your nose. AC wouldn't want to miss a sale just because you're sleeping! Being now awake looked at menu which offers ""selection of wines"" - turns out this means red or white one brand each. Ordered pieces of stiff cardboard and plastic paid full bar prices. In future AC would have to be the only carrier on a route before I'd fly them again and I would never recommend them. I remember when AC was a lot better than this.",0
KL from OOL return. All I can say about this airline is that you get what you pay for. They do not give good service and they really couldn't give a stuff about me in KL. LCCT in KL is not a very nice place to stay at unfortunately I had booked a room at Tune Hotel for 2 days when I went over - even worse I booked it for 3 days on my return to KL - man what a mistake that was. I would advise anyone to spend the extra few hundred dollars and fly a full service airline. I booked the XL seats they were a waste small and uncomfortable.,0
Round trip from San Francisco to Limau plus 4 in-country flights and found it no better or no worse than US or European airlines. The food was okay but not great and service was about what on expects these days. No great complaints.,1
"When I purchased the ticket I thought the price wasn't bad. I usually fly Southwest and now I know why. If I wanted to chose a seat that would cost me. I was shocked to see I couldn't even take a small carry-on - I had to check it or pay more. A box to measure your carry on was placed at the boarding area, with a big sign saying $100. The young man kept reiterating, ""if your luggage doesn't fit in this box, you will be charged $100 at the gate."" He repeated this announcement over and over again. No peanuts. The water, sodas etc cost. Flight attendants had snobby, pushy aggressive attitudes. No smiles, no hello. The seats don't recline and your knees touch the seat in front of you - I am 5'4"". I will never fly this airline again. I was so disappointed. Not to mention they made an announcement about signing up for their Credit Card, and receiving some free mileage. I don't think so - too many hidden costs for me.",0
MAD-PRG on A319 plane. Everything from check-in to arrival was great. Staff at check-in counter accommodated my friend and I with emergency exit seats. Plane was clean and comfortable. Onboard flight attendants were pleasant providing courteous and professional service. Sufficient drink runs were made and call requests responded to swiftly. A drawback was that no catering was offered not even a purchase option for a near 3 hour journey.,1
Chicago O'Hare to London Heathrow on 2 May. check in very fast and efficient. New 777 plane. Take off and landing about 30 minutes late. Friendly flight crew. Efficient service. Good vegetarian meal. Very pleasant flight.,1
DUR-JHB-CAI. BEY-CAI-JHB-DUR. Excellent comfort and great value for money. Seats were wide plenty if legroom and good footrest. No PTV was a large drawback though but I sleep though out the whole flight. A great airline and will use them again.,1
Abu Dhabi to Malaga on 13th/June. I was shocked with their onboard service. The first flight was 6.5 hours from Abu Dhabi to Rome. They only served a single drink and breakfast. In fact they should have also served a meal. The second flight from Rome to Malaga. The flight is 2.45 hours. I was shocked. they only served a drink and a packet of Pretzels. We were all waiting for a meal. Nothing came. Alitalia is worse than a budget airline. Never again.,0
PEK-CAN. Boeing 737 looked old but it was fairly comfortable. I had just flown in from Seattle via Hainan and was a great experience but this one was not as good. To my surprise the same FA's who were on the previous leg of the trip from SEA to Beijing were on the flight and were a little crabby after 12 hours on a different plane. When I said I didn't want any food she seemed concerned and only after much persuading did she go away. Overall not the best but not horrible.,1
What can I say about long haul KLM? A true tale of extremes: Pros: Value for money (only Â£560 return ABZ-SIN via AMS). Lounge at AMS (free food drinks wifi and showers via Petroleum Card). Food and Beverage onboard was to a surprisingly good standard for economy airline food and freely available. Staff were attentive and helpful. Cons: Seat didn't recline anywhere near as much as it does in any other airline Ive flown with and felt really cramped - I found this odd given the Dutch are the tallest in the world! IFE was so dated and a limited poor selection of music films and TV. Cabin decor is dull. All in all not too bad but the cons niggled away at me.,1
Very new EMB170 plane. Plane was 2/3 full for both legs and only snacks were served (7:30AM and 8:35PM flight). Bus gate in both airports One purser and one air stewardess on board. since the flying time is about two hours one person is sufficient enough to serve all the passengers on board.,0
Airbus 330 flight from Honolulu to Las Vegas. Aircraft had new AVOD but they charge for movies. Free dinner was served with rice beef and veggies. Crew came around with water and juice during flight. Flight on time and seating in the new aircraft is very good. Check in kiosk did not work so we had to do it with staff together.,1
What a horrible product AA offers in the back of the plane for longer flights. I flew from Manaus to Miami overnight and could not get comfortable in the nasty thin under padded seats. The meal service was a soggy ham sandwich and a glutinous dessert while the entertainment was provided by screens that dropped down from the ceilings. Even small Air Canada planes have seat back TVs but American's 737s do not and this on a 5-hour flight. When they dimmed the cabin lights the screens kept playing the film so good luck trying to get any sleep with the flashing lights in your eyes. Awful just awful. It is a throwback to the 1990s.,0
Flew Air Zena economy class PRG-TBS on 08.06.04 and on 11.06.04 TBS-CDG on both occasions in B737-500. Seating pitch fine and both planes well maintained. Departures on time on both occasions. The IFE consisted of a video and sound system but neither worked on the outbound flight. The hot meals on both flights were nothing special but a hot meal is becoming increasingly rare these days. As the only alcoholic drink available on the drinks trolley was one - yes one - bottle of beer it had long gone by the warm and friendly if quiet cabin crew reached me. The flight crew were silent throughout on both flights; for my part I appreciate announcements from the cockpit once in a while just so that you know someone is there. The cabin crew could take stronger measures to ensure that passengers remain in their seats as soon as the plane touches down. Some passengers retrieved their outsized cabin baggage from the overhead bins very shortly after arrival at TBS and blocked the aisle with the same. Evacuation in an emergency would not have been easy. Overall by no means the worst but by no means the best.,0
Hong Kong - Sydney (CX139 - Boeing 777-300ER 3 Class). An overall excellent flight with an excellent selection of movies music and games on the seatback IFE. Food was excellent and was presented in a way that make it look like something that is edible. Cathay has never fails to deliver the service needed for a five star airline. The seats were comfortable enough allowing me to catch up on my sleep. However this time around the cabin crew seemed annoyed but did the best to hide it. It was noticeable that the FA's were tired and wished to go to sleep at anytime. But they did their best to hide it which is commendable.,1
We traveled between July and September 2013. My friend travels with a portable kidney machine. I notified them of this fact when I made the reservation by computer. I was told he could bring the machine and another medical bag for free. When it was time to board the plane they took everybody  except the disabled persons first including children in strollers. I think a person with a kidney machine should trump a child with a stroller for boarding. When we got onto the plane I asked one on the flight attendants where we could store this somewhat heavy kidney machine. She promptly told us there was no room to store it other than the overhead bin. I told her I couldn't lift this machine over my head. Another flight attendant and the disabled person lifted it into the overhead. On the return trip we just decided to check it in. The woman at the check-in desk was very accommodating.,0
London (LHR) to Los Angeles (LAX) via Chicago (ORD) in First. Bag drop at LHR was easy. Flagship lounge a little antiseptic but welcoming enough. Boarding straightforward. Plane on the transatlantic section looked a little tired inside but the seat was enormous and very comfortable. Food and drinks very good and service outstanding. If I have a gripe it's that the IFE wasn't great and the TV of poor quality. Domestic leg was OK but I wouldn't expect the same class of treatment on such a flight.,1
1st Class LHR-PHX. Totally seamless flight. Great driver collection through concierge service (granted it was extra). Concorde room was lovely great staff and nice breakfast. First class service onboard staff were very good. Producing a very nice custom meal for my wife.,1
LHR-HKG on the new A380 in premium economy and it was a great trip staff were friendly and the food was very good for a gluten free meal. The only thing that I think they could improve on which Cathay has is the dedicated check in and boarding for there flights other than that it was an enjoyable trip.,1
Flew LH 454 21 Aug 14 FRA-SFO A380 and LH797 31 Aug 14 HKG-FRA B748. Great service provided in the air as well as on the ground. Food choices were good and fresh. Unfortunately the A380 still had the old angle-flat seat. The B748 had the new flat beds.,1
I am an experienced flyer but had never flown with WestJet until a few days ago and I will never fly with them again. The service on the Cancun to Toronto flight was appalling. I was flying with my sister who has 2 young children. We were boarded first but only after approaching the attendants as there was no pre-boarding call. Once on the plane my sister asked if she could go to the back to stand with her 5 month old child to put him to sleep while the plane was loading. The flight attendant said no there was no room so have a seat. After take off passengers were bombarded with merchandise play books (as there was no in-flight entertainment provided) headsets food drinks duty free. You had brief mins. of opportunity to go to the washroom as the aisles were always blocked by carts and you were told to sit down and wait while they finished their task. The staff were very unprofessional and rude. At the end of the flight passengers were not even acknowledged as all the attendants were at the back of the plane talking amongst each other.,0
Round-trip from Taipei to Siem Reap via Ho Chi Minh City. No long lines at check-in. All the planes (A321) seemed new inside and out and were quite roomy inside. I am tall and was especially happy with the amount of legroom. All of my seats were almost like Economy Plus seats on United Airlines. All flights left on time and arrived earlier than expected. The flight crew were not particularly friendly but were efficient. I have to say that the last flight was a bit hot and stuffy and I could have used some air conditioning but it wasn't horrible. Our bags were promptly delivered on both legs. It was a good experience overall and I wouldn't hesitate to fly with them again.,1
Decided to pay more for an economy return flight to Jamaica as I wanted to fly with Virgin (Â£200 more than their competitive airline). The last and only time I flew with them was about 10 years ago return flight to New York. Back then the return economy flight cost me Â£250 the flight had better entertainment and proper games with consoles was offered newspapers and the food and drink served was offered practically non-stop in fact I was given 2 main meals! Also very lucky on the return flight as it was practically empty we were given a glass of champagne! This time got 1 small main meal (and didn't eat the salad as it consisted of one small leaf and lots of dressing that tasted of dish water) afternoon tea consisted of 1 biscuit and tea or coffee steward gave me a look when I asked for 2 drinks and only good thing about the entertainment was the selection of films. I don't know why the stewards seemed stressed when the plane was half full! Also on return flight back staff at the airport had an attitude and didn't even welcome or say hello to me! They insisted I put items from my hand luggage into my suitcase as it was 1 kilo over! All this wonderful service cost me just under Â£800 for a return ticket! My friend flew with American airlines (via Miami) and basically got the same service and quality food and drinks I had from my original Virgin flight 10 years ago. So in conclusion I will never fly with Virgin again.,0
ZRH-SOF. Flight on time good service onboard friendly staff. Aircraft a bit old. Good value for money.,1
"Frontier is no different from other US based airlines. Same lower quality interiors, comfort, poorer service and lack of respect for economy class passengers. Frontier goes a step forward and uses the following tactics to foster its revenues: 1) Bait and switch schedules. 2) Nickel and dime everything from seat selection, food, beverages, and carry on bags. My family booked a flight back in January for a journey in April. We thought we got a good price and a schedule that fit our needs. Few weeks later we were contacted by our travel agent to inform us that Frontier had canceled the return flight. We were offered the following choices: 1) Go on a flight the following day - Frontier would not compensate for any added expenses. 2) Cancel for no charge and rebook on another airline for an additional $400, because tickets prices had increased in the interim. We were pretty much forced to go with option 1. Also, while doing an online check-in the Frontier system pretty much ""confuses"" you into paying unnecessary fees. We had the foresight to skip that process during seat selection, whereby it automatically assigned us a seat without additional fees. We were not so lucky as it suckered us to pay cabin baggage fees that no one bothered to check at the gates and smarter passengers had avoided. Essentially the system threatens you will be charged more at the gate and that you are better of paying online. I'd take my chances at the gate. ",0
MAO-MGA-SJO-SDQ-PTY-MAO. Still find their fares very affordable and fair service is good mix of nice cabin crew and boring ones but that you find on every single airlines! the inflight service is a little bit poorer. And such a great plane the Embraer!,1
"Just returned from a two week trip to China using AA into Beijing returning from Shanghai. We've traveled to over 70 countries world wide and this was the first and last time we'll ever use American Airlines. They use a 777-200 out of Chicago which resembles a cattle car the way passengers are packed into the economy section. 2-5-2 configuration and while we paid extra to sit in the two side the seats were so cramped there wasn't enough room between rows to put the tray table down for meals. When the passengers in front reclined their seats it was claustrophobic. Keep in mind this is a 14 hour flight. Ironically enough the flight attendants who refer to this equipment as the Slave Ship told us AA is talking about adding another row of seats. Meals were horrid power port and audio jacks didn't work and the ""entertainment"" system is laughable. We had three flights in China on China Eastern Airlines while we were there and their aircraft were all modern clean and spacious. If this is what we can expect from the American/US Airways merger I will avoid the new company at all costs.",0
"Flew from New York to Beijing via Toronto in May and coming back June 11th. I was badly surprised by the lack of professionalism of Air Canada FA. I was spoilt with hot liquids, water and juice 3 times during the flight from Beijing to Toronto, by different FA. Full flight both times, no smiles and kindness from any of the flight attendants, they were rude and seem to be very upset with some of the passengers. Our flight from PEK-YYZ was delayed due to two passengers missing, and while waiting on board, one of the FA's over the microphone said ""Perhaps we should give a round applause to the two passengers missing"". I find this very disrespectful and inappropriate. Overall, not a pleasant flight, rude cabin crew who shouted for people to remain seated, they didnt seem to care for passengers and they we were just doing their job with minimum standards. Very disappointing experience with Air Canada.",0
London Luton to Bordeaux (Billi Terminal) 22 May 2013 13.00. Return Bordeaux (Billi Terminal) to London Luton 26 May 2013 16.10. I couldn't pre-book check-in baggage for the return flight only. When I arrived to the airport I was charged for Â£25/??0 to check in my bag. Even if the website doesn't allow you to pre-book your baggage on one flight if you book a round trip (Â£187 + Â£25) it would be better to book another airline. On an anther flight I had no food and beverages on board as the service was too slow so they couldn't save me before landing. I spent 1hr 20mins with no drinks.,0
Very claustrophobic - hardly any leg room on board and I say that as a relatively small person. We were penned into a cold stairwell to wait for 45 mins before boarding which was uncomfortable and smelly. The tickets were cheap but the airline seemed to go out of its way to make the experience as wretched as possible.,0
Flew Melbourne to Adelaide with a toddler and baby. Unfortunately flew Jetstar as it fitted in best with nap times. Staff didn't even try to help as I struggled up the rear stairs with baby in sling toddler and bag. Consistently the worst customer service of all of the Australian airlines. Reiterated why I will only ever fly Jetstar if the timing and route is by far the best option.,0
LHR ??LAX Club World A380 return a week later LAX-LHR on 773 in First. Outbound left almost on time excellent considering a full large aircraft. Food and drinks service speedy an improvement on a year ago when the A380 entered service and lunch took 3 hours start to end! Opted for lower deck front row middle two seats -perfect for friends not so much for strangers. Prefer lower deck on outbound due to the middle seats and high ceilings / wide aisles. Feels very spacious. Arrival at LAX improved and staff were very pro active in splitting ESTA and non and passengers and getting people through as quickly as possible. Return flight outstanding. First lounge not yet open however used Business Lounge and was quiet with excellent service. Priority boarding and walked to seat. CSM introduced himself and explained that only 8 out 14 seats booked (rarity on this route) and as such had two seats each! Middle seats for dining and sleeping then moved back to windows for breakfast and landing. Food and service very attentive ??never a wait for anything had to start turning down drinks. Washbags had not been loaded at Heathrow and sleeping suit size not available but given Club washbag and as a gesture the crew gave a bottle of Grand Siecle to take away ??worth far more than a couple of wash bags! Could not fault the three cabin crew serving landed on time and bags were at carousel before us. Can't wait to fly First to Singapore next year and compare the A380 service.,1
Flew from Halifax (YHZ) to St. John's (YYT) with Westjet on 22 September. Check in online was smooth baggage drop at the airport was swift with friendly staff. At the gate was upgraded to Economy Plus seating the extra room was nice flight crew were good and service was very pleasant. Flight was smooth and on time baggage service good. I would not hesitate to fly with Westjet again.,1
Heathrow to Mauritius return. Not sure what all the negative comments are about - personally I had a lovely flight with Air Mauritius. Crew were friendly food was fine and seat was fine too. As for entertainment - I'm not too bothered but there seemed to be an ok selection of movies and music etc.! Overall if you're flying economy a plane is a plane and a seat is a seat so take AM and have a nice trip to Mauritius.,1
"We had a nearly 3-hour delay on 10 Nov on our SIN-DPS flight (VF241). We were told that the computerised check-in system was down. At the start of the delay there were confusion on what to do and the communication to the passengers affected was poorly managed. At times there were discrepancy between the instruction by Jetstar Asia and Changi Airport's staffs. We were originally in the ""web-check in"" queue since we had checked in online but was redirected to a long queue specifically for our flight afterwards. Apparently the web check in queue was functioning soon after we left out queue to join a super long queue. To make things worse at the boarding gate we were told that our seats (which we paid for) has been taken by others! My wife and I have to either sit separately staff did not even bother to ask the passengers whether they were open to a switch? In short the delay was badly managed.",0
16th June 2014 I flew to Vienna to see my daughter. I was very apprehensive as we boarded the 14.15 from Terminal 1 but I must admit everything was perfect the staff were excellent and the fight was great. We had ordered a meal on the return flight not really expecting much but it was well worth the money never expected all the trimmings ie: bun and butter fresh fruit sweet cheese and the meal itself was delicious (Sausage and Mash). My travel companion was also more than satisfied with her meal all in all a thoroughly enjoyable flight which was so pleasing after so long without taking a flight.,1
I recently flew to Las Vegas from Calgary and back by Westjet. Flights were very late in both directions. There was no TVs on either flight. I pre-ordered food for the flight for myself and the person I was travelling with. When the flight attendants came they wanted to know if I wanted to buy anything. I told them I already did and had a copy of the receipt on my phone. The flight attendants were then running around looking for the food. The food was not on the flight. Two attendants told us to pick something else in exchange for when I bought. We picked and the attendant then tried to get me to pay for it again. On their website for pre-ordering food you can contact them by e-mail if there was a problem. I did that oer a week and a half ago and no one replied. I usually fly Air Canada but Westjet advertised a better flight time. Since we were so late the Air Canada flight would have been about the same time and I would not have had to sit in the airport for late flights in both directions.,0
Bombay-Jaipur return Pune-Nagpur. Easy check in and nice friendly staff in Bombay. On the return (Jaipur to Bombay) we were asked to carry no hand baggage onboard as it was a high security day. The airline could have informed us earlier as had breakable stuff in my hand baggage and they forced me to check it in. Pune to Nagpur efficient and competent crew.,1
"Rome to Frankfurt in Airbus 321. Lufthansa could not help that at Rome Airport the lounges were closed, however a voucher of 10??was rather limited - for a small snack and 2 basic non alcoholic drinks I paid 17 ?? Flight delayed on departure due to extremely strong winds at Frankfurt airport. Once boarded FA's were friendly - meal was rather basic for this flight, drinks just OK. Frankfurt to Brussels flight had a delay of nearly one hour due to stormy winds. When seated for 20 minutes onboard, drinks were provided to all passengers. Captain did give ample information - meal ok, luggage could have been faster at Brussels airport.",1
Excellent trip - 11 Sep from Chicago to Dubai via Amman in Crown Class. Check-in quick with friendly agents - given pass to Air France/KLM lounge in Chicago. Plenty of food and drinks literally next to the departure gate. Boarding priority for Crown Class - directed to my seat on the A340 by friendly FA from Romania. She and the Purser continued excellent service from take-off to landing - friendly and personable. Only 1/3 full so lots of space - older style seat but so much room! You basically had 5 aircraft windows of space when reclined. Food service old-style - on a cart for each passenger to be serviced individually - very classy. Quality and quantity of food excellent. Entertainment was ok - they need more options for films and TV shows. Arrived 1 hour early into Amman - transit in the lounge - more high quality food. Dubai flight was full A321 - again great service and excellent food. Landed on time and bags were out relatively quickly. I look forward to my return flight back to Chicago.,1
We flew London Heathrow to Singapore business class for the first time with BA and was not impressed - the cabin crew did the bare minimum they could get away with and as for the seating arrangement we just could not get our head around it - thank goodness we changed our seats prior to flight - we sat on the 2 outer seats that were ok though a bit narrow - felt so sorry for the people who sat in the middle seats as they had to face strangers on the take off and landing - we fly long haul on this route 4 times a year and can quite honestly say that after our experience with BA we would not wish to fly with them again.,0
Flew Norwegian for a break Gatwick to Barcelona compared to the British operators EasyJet and Ryanair Norwegian fared better in comparison. The fares were low aircraft the 737-800 good legroom good professional service from elegant cabin crew can't this airline expand its network out of LGW I found it top of its game all-round for the short haul budget sector!,1
GA368 SUB-SRG on Jan 7 2014. Although using Bombardier CRJ1000 and only 45 minutes flight Garuda Indonesia successfully managed to deliver service as pleasant as in Boeing 737-800 flights from Surabaya. Good cabin ambience in small aircraft. No PTVs but still got a complimentary snack. I am hoping that this route should be operated with larger aircraft soon because it is not easy to get cheap fares in full capacity routes like SUB-SRG.,1
Terrible service. Food was better in economy. Seats were awful - unable to adjust it so you could get comfortable and we are 5ft and 6ft so it should have worked for one of us. Headphone socket broken so unable to watch movies or listen to music. Staff just said 'we can't fix it in flight'. Movies NOT on-demand and you are not informed when they start. Definitely not worth the extra. This was AKL-PPT. Go with Air NZ instead.,0
London Heathrow to Islamabad Pakistan July 24th 2013 Boeing 777-200ER. Aircraft was scheduled to be a Boeing 777-300ER but it changed to a smaller aircraft - a Boeing 777-200ER which was chaos! Some passengers couldn't fly and everyone's seats changed! As we boarded we were greeted by cabin crew. Our meal was chicken curry rice and vegetable curry served with bread butter drinks etc. The meal was fantastic! Inflight Entertainment screens were about to be switched on when all the passengers realized only about 10 out off 200 screens were working! We had no entertainment for 7 hours. Always bring an Ipad Ipod or entertainment device with you. The cabin crew were fantastic! They always had a smile on their face and communicated with passengers very politely! I would only recommenced PIA If you have patience and don't mind about no entertainment.,1
Flight Jakarta to Bali was 2 hours delayed. Return flight 3 hours delayed. I tried to call their service center several times but no one answers the phone. No notification of delays until you get to the airport. Time is extremely important when traveling. It is obvious that despite their reasonably low fares they don't care for their customers. I will never fly this airline again.,0
A few days ago I returned from Banja Luka. Although the ATR72 was quite noisy the service was excellent especially for the 45 minute flight. Change in quality in comparison with old JAT is highly visible.,1
Flew SA Express CPT-DUR and previously DUR-CPT-DUR. Crew have always been excellent. They are warm and friendly right from boarding where we are always greeted by a great smile. Food is good sandwiches for dinner with chocolate for dessert. A good selection of drinks were offered. Leather seats are very comfortable but are now showing some signs of age. Love flying SA Express because their planes always seem private and warm. Baggage was on the carousel quickly from deplaning. Overall three great experiences with SAX.,1
"I was extremely angry about being charged the extra baggage fee for cabin bags, and the staff were rude when they charged the fee. 45 euro for each and we two persons paid 90 euro in total. I have taken many flights over several years, and never been charged for this kind of small cabin bag, even on many other cheap airlines. There was no apparent reason for it. It was just a cynical ploy to earn an extra bit of money. I won't be travelling with Wizz Air again.",0
LAX to GRU in business. Service on the ground the best I have encountered. Left my cell in the cab and the ticket agent worked with me to get my phone back. Lounge was decent in LAX but TBIT is awful. Very comfortable seat with enough leg room for me at 6'3. Food service was very weak and I had to constantly ask for extra water as the FAs were nowhere to be found. Was hungry after both meals which was odd but they were very bready and lacked substance. Slept for most of the flight. Overall an outstanding flight with great ground service and decent in flight service.,1
MEL-BWN (777) BWN-BKK (A320). Booked this flight several months in advance at an almost impossible price (at least $300 cheaper other airlines). First flight was on a very old 777 but well maintained. I slept most of the flight only waking to eat. Attendants friendly and welcoming. Second flight was on a newer A320. Again attendants fantastic and extremely polite and attentive. Despite being a shorter flight we were offered hot meals which were delicious considering the price we paid.,1
Feb 1 - Feb 8 Ottawa - Puerto Vallarta. Flight out was 5.5 hours late due to late departure from Cuba and slow service in Ottawa. Were given meal vouchers and waited. Flight was fine elite seats with extra leg room was nice but seat mates who sprawl aren't. Entertainment system wasn't working properly - sound kept dropping out. Service was fine. Return was 1.5 hours late but was on day of major storm in Canada that saw many stranded but not us. Flight was fin. All in all no worse no better than other charter airlines.,1
Krasnodar - Moscow - Omsk. Check-in in Krasnodar was chaotic and no drop bags and run counter. (It was peak summer season). The actual flights were OK. I received my preferred seats on both flights and quite good English spoken by cabin staff. Reasonable meals were served on both flights evening though the Omsk sector started at 1.40 am. Both sectors were fairly well on time although departing Krasnodar was a little late (because of the problems with checking in. No entertainment on either flight - both around 3 hours).,1
Check-in at Manchester was awful we waited 20mins to check-in. The check-in agent couldn't change my seat no other staff to help. Flight late departing no announcements and no gate staff to ask with a scrum to board when finally called. Aircraft clean but seating cramped and seat broken and kept reclining - after the cabin crew asked 3 times for me to move it she finally listened that it was broken. Cabin crew were not very friendly and on arrival waited 15mins for baggage - GCI airport is tiny and no other flights in so cant understand the wait. Return flight delayed - and on arrival parked at the terminal and yet had to be bussed around the airport. Overall dated airline.,0
Our flight from PBI to LGA was diverted to JFK. Upon landing they stated that a bus will be provided for transfer to LGA. After waiting more than an hour no bus at all. Pay my own transfer don't provide service if you are not prepared to provide it.,1
Manchester to JFK via Dublin. Flight from Manchester to Dublin was delayed for 1 hr through no fault of Aer Lingus. They held the plane for us at Dublin and as soon as we arrived we were personally ushered straight through passport control and US customs. I was impressed the flight attendants friendly and helpful the food good and the inflight entertainment was excellent.,1
Flew Emirates MAN-DXB-KUL and back. A380 from MAN-DXB and B777-300ER from DXB-KUL andmB777-300ER for all legs back to MAN from KUL. The overall flight experience is below average. The seat was OK and a bit weary and some seats had visible stains. The aisle was too narrow the meal cart always hit the the aisle seats every time the cabin crew served the meal. The meal was below average nothing impressive about it. The crew have to learn to be more friendly and definitely need more training to communicate with the passengers. Toilets were fairly dirty after a few hours and crew couldn't be bothered to look after them. The only good thing about the flight experience was the entertainment system. I am totally disappointed as I was expecting Emirates to be one of the best airlines in the world.,0
We flew in March for a trip from London to Sweden. The flight back was delayed 6 hrs and 49 mins due to a technical problem with the plane which meant that we waited at Arlanda airport until 4am for a flight that was supposed to leave around 9pm. Norwegian refused to pay for a hotel during the delay and only gave us a voucher for about Â£15 each for dinner. The staff were beyond unhelpful. Information was only given when you dragged it out of them. I will never be flying with this airline again.,0
I had two different impressions of two flights with VA. The first flight was from London Heathrow to Los Angeles Premium Economy and it was great even though the seat I had wasn't the most convenient in term of its location. I didn't sleep and for the whole flight stewards were always there asking if I need something else offering drinks snacks ice creams. The second flight was back home from Los Angeles to London Heathrow Premium Economy and that was a totally different story. It all started from the delayed main meal. In the Economy they were already finishing their meal but ours wasn't even served. Then the meal was served eaten and we had our dirty dishes in front of us for like an eternity. Nobody seemed to care about collecting the dishes the stewards seemed to be hectically busy with something behind the closed curtains - but with what? At some point a lady in front of me decided to recline her chair and doing that she squeezed my dirty dishes so I had to call the stewards and request to remove them. Then we were waiting for a coffee - for more than an hour. I reminded about a coffee a couple of times but again the stewards were just too busy with something not related to serving the passengers. Then there was another lengthy period more than an hour of waiting for liquors. The light was already switched off and most passengers were asleep when at last some brandy was offered. And then the Premium Economy stewards simply disappeared and didn't show up until closer to the end of the flight. Nobody was offering drinks nobody was asking if passengers need anything there was simply no service in Premium Economy. On the way back from the toilet I met Economy stewards who were serving drinks they offered a drink to me. Were Premium Economy stewards on strike or something? I have no idea. My rates below will reflect my experience of the return flight. I will fly with VA again in July to San Francisco Premium Economy and I hope I will never meet again the team that I was unlucky to meet on my return from Los Angeles.,0
Space was very tight. Food trays were too small and seats were very uncomfortable. Flight was very boring due to no entertainment. I'm sure SAA can do much better than this. All in all it was an okay flight. Service was alright.,0
We have just returned from a week in Gran Canaria. This was our first flight with Ryanair and our first online flight booking. We are not very good on computer bookings and missed the fact that you need to print 2 boarding passes even though we had two separate sheets with two different flight numbers on. We accept that this was our fault but I like to think this was human error. Again we accept that staff cannot be expected to spend hours printing off tickets for idiots! However do you really need to charge so much to do so? Also the receptionist who had to deal with us was not fully experienced and needed to employ the help of her colleagues which caused extended delay to three queues instead of one making us feel very embarrassed and small.,0
YYC-NRT we were lucky to get upgraded on this near empty flight and very much enjoyed the premium perks Business Class on AC had to offer Seats were comfortable mood lighting eased jet lag and food was spectacular.,1
HK-Toronto via Taipei - Economy. It was my second time taking this route and I am just as impressed as the first time around at how well this airline is run. The seats are great for economy the food is excellent cabin crew are top-notch and most important this airline is by far the most 'on time' airline I've even flown with. We were about 15 minutes late out of the gate in Taipei but the pilots made up for it by getting us to Toronto an hour and a half early. With the consistent quality excellent pricing and value I am still not sure why this airline is still only four star. I normally take the same route with Cathay at almost double the price for a typically terrible customer experience. The Asia - N. America carrier scene is getting shook up by EVA and there should be more attention paid to it. Well done!,1
Took MH760 from KUL-SGN on 19th February 2015. I was upgraded to Business Class through MH Upgrade option. Definitely worth the money. The Regional Golden Lounge was superb! The lunch served Chicken Biryani was delicious together with Cappuccino Cake as a dessert. Cabin crew was usual MH top notch friendly staff definitely recommend the MH Upgrade option to experience MH Business Class service. Will always choose MH as preferred airlines to fly with.,1
LHR-SIN-SYD and return. A380 for the first and third legs B777 for the second and fourth. Booked early enough to get the upstairs economy cabin for the A380 flights seats in rows of two with a storage bin on the window side. Only quibble which is trivial is that the library of movies and audio books wasn't that great. Helpful cabin crew rebooted non-functioning IFE very promptly on one leg. Fruit option for meals excellent. Hot towels and regular juice/water supplies much appreciated and the service across the board could not be faulted - the crews seem highly efficient anyway but it helps that there are enough staff for them not to get irritable through needing to work at breakneck pace. We've done this journey with Qantas when they flew Heathrow-Sydney Singapore but switched because a Dubai-Sydney leg is just too long. T3 at Changi is an oasis of calm compared to Dubai and if you book flights with a medium layover you can be asleep in the airside transit hotel minutes after landing. A definite choice of airline and route when we next make the trip.,1
For this 90 min shuttle flight from Fukuoka to Tokyo - Haneda ANA packs in the seats fitting 405 seats on an old 777-200. That's the dreaded 10 seats abreast. Thankfully the flight was not full so we could spread out. The service is minimal as is the interior design giving this flight a truly bus-like feel. I know these flights are meant to be practical but why do they have to also make them boring?,1
SOU-PMI-SOU. Its a while since I flew from SOU and had forgotten what a joy it is; easy quick very friendly and smiley staff at the airport. Had a 30 min delay boarding as the fire service hadn't started work and we weren't allowed to board until they started. Once on board crew were attentive and helpful. Arrived on time. Coming home all went according to plan and crew were excellent. Arrived bang on time and had collected bags and were out of the airport within 15 minutes of touching down! Excellent.,1
MNL-KL-CDG Dec. 20 2014 and returned Jan. 4 2015. The trip to Paris was delayed from Manila and we were concerned that we might either miss the flight to Paris or our baggage might get delayed. Luckily this didn't happen. We also had chef on call meals which was a good option. The flight from KL-CDG used the A380 and it was a good experience for us overall. However on the return flight we tried to request the meal via email but their office was closed since they only work Monday to Friday Malaysian time. We asked at check-in but it was too late. No amenities onboard - when I asked the staff they said they were forgotten by the airline. We arrived into KL with about an hour to spare before the next flight (this was meant to be a 2 hour layover) but when we arrived in Manila our luggage was not with us. The plane from KL to Manila was old and dirty.,0
Vancouver to Calgary on May 26th with my 2 children. My son has Down syndrome and autism so he travels with a Service dog. Our flight attendant was friendly and personable and she asked if there was anything extra that we needed and anything she and the other flight attendants should know in case of emergency. She pointed out to me that there is an extra oxygen mask which in emergency I could put on the service dog no other flight attendant had ever pointed that out to me before after 5 years of travelling by plane at least once a year. It was not a busy flight so the check in desk even gave our family an extra seat so there would be more room for the dog to stretch out. A pleasant travel experience.,1
"Every time I fly on an American Airlines they lose my luggage, and the planes are always broken. On my way back to MO last time, the plane was delayed in Phoenix for 4 hours, before they finally switched us to a new plane. They still managed to mess up getting my luggage back that night. This time, my flight left an hour late because of AC issues. When we land in Dallas for my transfer, I went from a 45 minute layover, to run as fast as I could to catch my gate. Got there as the door was closing. Turns out that didn't matter, because there was an issue with this plane too. Apparently, one seat was not functioning. I will never fly AA again. ",0
"Flew from Inverness to Jersey on 9th Aug and enjoyed a marvellous holiday. Returning Sat 16th on BE 1573 and when checking in told we were going to Glasgow. Due to leave at 12.45 but boarded at 1.45 to be told that due to staff sickness we were going to Glasgow and then coach to Inverness not just a few passengers a full flight of 70 plus. Obviously the people of Glasgow were more important than those from the Highlands as far as Flybe are concerned. Attitude of male steward on flight was deplorable and when couple behind me expressed their disquiet his reply was ""you are lucky to get a flight"". Coach was a further shambles felt every bump struggled up inclines and no toilet for a four hour trip. Disgraceful treatment.",0
The check-in security procedure is far too invasive including asking to see photographs on my camera itinerary on my laptop receipts etc. I understand the need for security but looking at personal photographs and items on my laptop is beyond ridiculous. The onboard service is mediocre food below mediocre and the quality of aircraft is below average - on two 6+ hour international flights we were subject to viewing in-flight entertainment on projection screens at the front of each section of the aircraft. My luggage was left in Tel Aviv even though there was a 5 hour layover.,0
Paris to Beijing in business class on a 777-300 and return from Shanghai to Paris in business class on A340. Seating on the 777 is excellent with new seats large TV screens and a 2-2-2 configuration. On the A340 the configuration was the same but there were older seats smaller TV screens though I cannot complain about seating. On both legs staff were friendly and attentive. What is disappointing was the quality of the meals. I have seldom tasted such bland food and the presentation was horrible. Before take-off only orange juice and water were served. Wines (good selection of French wines) were excellent but must have been very expensive because there was no second serving nor were liquors offered at the end of the meal. Another drawback was the total absence of reading materials in English or in French except a few China Daily newspapers. A large proportion of the offered movies were oldies. If you are not interested in food if you bring your own reading materials Air China is a good option as it is cheap and not too many people fly it so you have plenty of space.,1
Possibly the worst mid haul airplane I've been on. Was booked through Etihad (superb airline) but got Seychelles instead! Frankly it felt like Ryanair or Easyjet. Give it the widest berth! I'll even avoid Etihad to avoid the chance of this tin pot airline.,0
Took SIN-KUL-PEN-KUL-SIN in February 2015 on Business Class. Each short leg I was served a hot tasty meal with linen napkins I was quite surprised. Very friendly professional staff. Clean cabins and warm Service. I was quite happy. There was no entertainment during the short flight.,1
SIN-CMB in Business Class. I take this flight as it leave/arrives at good times and avoids overnight flying. They recently changed from A330 to A320 and there is a big difference. A320 is cramped no leg rests (in row 1) little recline lack of overhead storage embarkation is a zoo! Meals are now on trays rather than the A330 trolley service. Crew seemed overworked. This compares to intra-European biz class or US domestic biz class on cheaper airlines. I would only recommend this service due to departure times.,1
CGK-PEK in business class. Very comfortable new design in cabin fully reclining seat and a warm welcoming smile from cabin crew.,1
I choose the cheapest flights and most convenient schedules available when travelling from Ireland and UK to other European destinations. Approx 9 times out of 10 the winner seems to be Ryanair (price and timing are great). When I choose EasyJet or Aer Lingus I'm delayed 9 times out of 10. Do you want luxury? Do you want 1hr to board a plane? Do you want 1 hr to disembark a plane? If the answer is yes then simply don't choose Ryanair! Are you someone who has several bags? Are you someone who complains and tries to inconvenience others around you? Are you someone who takes 1 flight per year? If so then don't fly Ryanair - and do the rest of us a favour. Let's be realistic. Who gave Europe cheap flights? Ryanair.,1
LHR-PEK-Tokyo RT in Business. One-word comment: Impressed. More: A330 on the long legs; 777 to Narita then A321 from Haneda to PEK. All flights on time; all aircraft clean and comfortable. A330 lie-flat seat up there in the business comfort stakes. Not Emirates but better than BA. Food acceptable if (for a westerner) a little idiosyncratic in the order of service. Decent wines - no whisky onboard the return from PEK to LHR. Instant coffee! IFE is probably good if you're Chinese! Very limited choice for English speaker.,1
I flew from Montreal to Barcelona on October 8. The seats were so uncomfortable. Not having a screen is really unpleasant since the space is so limited that even holding an iPad becomes difficult. The hot meal was quite good although it is really trimmed down to the bare essentials. Cheap cellophane wrapped piece of cake that is meant to be breakfast! Were is the juice? The yogurt? The fruit? Really pitiful. I will not fly Rouge again if I can help it.,0
"Avoid Air India at all costs. The ""Business Class"" was anything but the seats were incredibly uncomfortable and you sit 4"" from the person next to you! There is no room to do work or anything else comfortably. The service was the worst I've had and the food was just as bad. These are very old aircraft and between the seats carpets and disgusting galley the old age shows! The inflight 'entertainment system' is vintage 1980's and the screens are effectively not usable.",0
Always a pleasure to fly in the turbo-prop ATR's. Cabin crew always polite interesting snacks on the Vientiane- Hanoi run and the particularly delightful and free Lao Beer. Sometimes a bit difficult to understand the accent of the flight crew. Great at check-in and immigration due to the small number of passengers carried on the aircraft certainly avoids the long waits experienced on the jets. It's an interesting and most pleasant experience and I do not hesitate to recommend Laos Airlines to travellers on the short haul flights. Definitely my favourite way to go between Laos and Vietnam and for domestic flights within Laos.,1
LAX to ORD via St. Louis one way in first. Both flights on time. Food was very good. Staff was very professional. All in all a very nice experience. Not much entertainment wise but these flights are not that long.,1
BOM-LHR-BOM. Food was too little and tasteless for the most part. Was served a cupcake and 100 ml of Orange juice for a breakfast meal. Only one drink served voluntarily by the crew ask for a second and they will hesitantly oblige. The only good thing about the flights was the seat which is better than BA or AI that fly this route. IFE needs to be updated and maintained only left side headphone worked for both flights.,1
"Travelled to Malta from Exeter on 28 August and returned on 11 September. Delayed by over 3 hours on outward journey only explanation was ""operational difficulties"" and we were given a paltry Â£6 voucher to get a snack. Nothing else was offered not even free phone calls even though that is an entitlement. On the return journey we were gain delayed by 45 minutes because of ""late arrival if the incoming flight"". The flights were good once we actually took off but the whole experience was so tiring and stressful that we will never fly with Air Malta again.",0
Flew from Calgary back to Vancouver in August was pleased with the service plane tickets were cheap the flight was on time and the children got a special package at the end of the flight. Would definitely use them again.,1
LHR-KWI-COK. LHR-KWI with lousy inflight entertainment system. The screen was tiny and the movies were repeated. KWI transit was pandemonium connection flight was delayed for hours. There were 3 departure gates with just one door to enter the gate area and passengers for 3 flights were catapulting themselves to get through the gates - ground staff were rude and unprofessional. While boarding the flight one of the ground staff snatched my cabin bag and was about to check-in literally at the door step of the flight with no questions asked. With my laptop in the cabin bag managed to get it from the staff and had to literally smuggle it inside the flight - cabin bag was within the permitted dimensions and I have travelled with the same cabin bag on many airlines. This was the worst experience ever.,0
Completely agree with D Finnie re: stupid rule of not being able to print boarding cards until 7 days before travel meaning you can't print your return flight boarding cards before leaving home if you are on holiday for 7 days or more. I had no access to internet whilst on holiday (which is the way most people want it as they are on holiday) so unable to print boarding cards and ended up having to pay 210 euros for 3 boarding cards at the airport. Completely ridiculous rule designed to make as much money out of us as possible. All other airlines allow you to print all boarding cards for your entire journey when you check-in online so can't understand why Ryanair don't. It should not be allowed. They lure you in with a cheap flight cost and charge you for everything else. I was really pleased when they announced they would have allocated seating on all flights which is much easier for those of us travelling with children so this should make it even easier to allocate a seat on return flight instead of making us customers with families having to pay at the airport for boarding cards. Ryanair did nothing about this even after I complained to them stating their rules as a legitimate reason and not accepting that the rule is wrong and needs to be changed.,0
"JNB to IAD. Second time I have flown long-haul international with SAA and the second time I've had a good flying experience. Seats are older but very comfortable for a large man (6'4"" tall). Service in business class was superb. Smiles warmth and left us alone while we slept. The crew changed out in Dakar. The second crew was just as friendly and just as good.",1
Seattle Tacoma International Airport to Taipei in Economy. Boarding is a mess the staff were terrible on when to call your zone. Most of the time you're flight will be delayed just because boarding took too long. The seat is fair for economy when you recline the bottom part of the seat it slides forward so you somewhat lay down. However there isn't a footrest. The width and recline is reasonable. I sat in the upper deck and I like that there is a compartment on the side therefore you have more legroom. You also get a very tiny pillow and surprisingly a nice blanket. The inflight meal is what you would expect for economy. You will have two choices. Flight attendants were the worst I have encountered. The inflight entertainment is awful the screen is smaller than an iPad mini and you have very limited choices of movies. Overall I wouldn't fly with EVA again.,0
Had a bad experience on the flight from Athens to Toronto on 5/24/2015. The service was slow no entertainment information prior to flight. 13 hours on the flight and had to movies TV shows because you need an Air Canada App to be able to view. Food was horrible and it was the first flight overseas by a major carrier that we had to pay for wine or any alcoholic beverages. But the biggest disappointment was the service of the staff. Never again will I spend the money to fly this airline.,0
SIN-CGK-MDC. Flights on time. Brand new planes nice looking interior. They accept US issued credit cards unlike other carriers. 20 kg of luggage is included in the price of ticket.,1
I have always been a fan because of the Gatwick-Florence link but after the third consecutive disaster no more. Gatwick's departures website had the flight as severely delayed but BA kept saying they knew nothing about a delay and would not re-book. The Meridiana rep had just gone home and not bothered to tell BA.,0
I traveled to NY in December of 2013 and although the flight out was fine and on time the flight back was cancelled and no flights were available for several days I ended up purchasing a one way ticket from Southwest which was one counter down for a full fare and made it back that night. Spirit never offered a refund or any compensation for cancelling a flight and not accommodating Last night my daughter was supposed to fly back from Florida to Chicago her flight was first delayed then finally cancelled. Again the airline did not offer any help and the first flight available they offered was 3 days later! which is outrageous! We found another flight on Spirit with available seat but the airline refused to allow the use of that seat and at best after demanding to talk to a supervisor we were told that non are available for 2 hours (which is after the flight departs). Needless to say we are so disappointed with this airline that we will never recommend for anyone to fly with them.,0
I recently flew on ANA Business Class from Narita to Chicago and was served my beef fillet uncooked (not even rare) and had to ask that it be cooked further. When we were served breakfast it wasn't even heated up cold omelette. Again we had to ask them to take it back and at least warm it. They warmed it to the minimum. Staff turns up the heat during flight (I assume to put everyone to sleep) as service is hard to come by in between meal service. Overall service and food needs to be improved to ensure quality service in all cabins. Service needs to be checked or aisles at least walked between meal services. Air temp. needs to be cooler. We were seated in business class. The seats are ok but still not comfortable when in flat bed mode. I would only take ANA again if I got a free ticket using miles.,0
Flight from Portugal to Brazil the seat had no working entertainment system when they came to me they had run out of all items except lasagne. The staff were rude and had no interest in solving the problems.,0
Flew out of Melbourne to BKK just after midnight Jan 3. Flight was Ok although the 777-200ER getting old with angled lie flat seats in J class uncomfortable. But worthy of note was the appalling TG shared Air New Zealand lounge. Although our flt was just after midnight the lounge was virtually shut with staff in pack-up mode with little food and limit drinks available. Because of this unlikely to fly TG again. Melb TG dept lounge (for late departure) - forget. Better options!,0
Toronto-Taipei-Fukuoka. Low cost airline with exceptional service. Their prices have gone up recently but if you manage to get a cheap flight with them the value for the money can't be beat. Excellent service excellent food good in-flight entertainment and timely departures. Not a very well known airline but highly recommended.,1
BKK-CMB on an A320. Was marginally better than my CMB-MLE flight last year. Half of the crew friendly and talkative other half very distanced and did the minimal tasks required of them. Got an emergency exit row and so very happy with seat space and comfort. IFE on demand and had a pretty satisfactory list of entertainment options. The food was surprisingly (based on my Maldives flight) the best aspect of the journey - an almost perfectly cooked breakfast. Flight departed 10 minutes late but caught up for lost time in the air. Baggage came out well timed.,1
Las Palmas to Stuttgart Jan 29 2012. Excellent service flight on time good food. Ordered breakfast online and received a nice and fresh sandwich on the side. Served refreshments 3 times during the 4 hour flight. Average pitch showed a movie on the overhead screens.,1
"MAD-SCL A340-600 30/12/2012. I arrived the T4 at Barajas at 21.00 and checked in efficiently at the Business counters with professional and polite staff. From there I went through the fast track security control also efficient and quick. My transfer from T4 to T4S went smooth. At the T4S I went to the Iberia business lounge which was spacious with great food and wines and with good views. After eating I had a rest in one of the beds in the quiet room. At 23.30 I proceeded to my gate. Boarding was on time and I was one of the first to enter. This was a very new Airbus 340-600. My seat was 1 A. I received a personal greeting together with a glass of champagne which was very pleasant. Slightly turbulent on-time take off. When airborne the pilot greeted us and informed us that the nights 13.20 hrs route would be: Lisbon-Canary Islands-Sao Luis-Tocantin-Santiago del Estero-Santiago de Chile. The sky was clear all the way over the Atlantic with some turbulence when approaching Brazilian territory. The seat was a fully flat bed with great width and length very comfortable to sleep in. The cell phone charger did not work but staff went ""out of their way"" to fix it. Food was great. I had scallops. The staff was personal and pleasant all the way. All in all a great business class experience! We touched ground at 09.30 in Santiago to a beautiful summer morning.",1
Have nothing but praise this airline. A competitor cancelled by misstake our return leg out of Liverpool to Basle and the ground staff was not helpful at all (to say it in a polite manner). What a difference at the VLM ticket counter. The woman knew our situation and offered us a reasonably priced ticket to LCY from where we could continue our journey. As we booked last minute and security checks etc. took longer we got denied boarding at the gate as the flight would have left late if it waited for us to be bussed to the aircraft. Received free lounge acces in Liverpool (A special offer at the moment) and free rebooking to the next flight. Friendly FAs served candies upon boarding and free food and drinks during the short flight. Of course it was somewhat like a cold hamburger but more important is the way they treat you. You might pay a bit more but you get treated as a human being. Arrival in LCY was smooth and in the terminal within minutes. Called their London office a couple of days ago for a copy of the electronic ticket. We need that to reclaim the money from their orange competitor. This request was handled promptly and with no problems! Their Fokker 50s are ok for the routes they use. All in all reminds me of what Crossair used to be years ago. Friendly staff nice service etc.,0
We recently returned from Dublin to Toronto then on to Winnipeg. Other than cutting it close due to limited staffing in Toronto our flight was excellent. Due to the rush in Toronto one of our carry ones was placed to go in the cargo hold. When we arrived in Winnipeg it stayed in Toronto they were most helpful and kind at the Winnipeg airport and we received 3 phone calls the following day in regards to the misplaced bag and it was delivered to our home. We are very thankful and more than appreciative of the service we received what a great end to a wonderful holiday.,1
HEL-ARL. Plane was Embraer 190. Cabin looked old and dirty. Flight attendants polite but cold and not very friendly. They offered complimentary water and blueberry juice. You don't need any snack in 45 minutes flight but I wanted coffee. Blueberry juice sounds nice fresh and very Finnish but there was only 15% juice of that drink not very healthy. It was also too sweet. Finnair has been very quality but now in short sectors you feel with them like travelling by the bus. Norwegian has cheaper prices and free WI-FI onboard. In future I prefer them if I'm travelling just with hand luggage.,0
"The flight was good, the price of the ticket was low - about AED 900. For the money we paid the service was really good, there are some problems like there is no food provided so we had to buy this onboard the plane. We did not have personal TV and the inflight entertainment was poor but the cabin crew service was good. I recommend if you want a cheap ticket with good service, but no entertainment onboard.",1
After using United for many years on my trips from the US to Berlin I was excited to try Air Berlin. The fare was more than UA but I decided to try them. Mistake! The crew on my ORD to TXL flight seemed interested only in getting the service over with ASAP. The food was terrible and served ungraciously. The seats are hard and more cramped than on UA (I did not opt to pay extra for an XXL seat since I'm 5'2 and weigh 98lbs I didn't think I needed it). On my return TXL to ORD the fight experience a mechanical problem resulting in a 2 hr delay. The ground staff made an unintelligible announcement and then retreated behind a glass partition where no one could ask them anything. Again on board service was without a single smile. Same terrible presentation and lacklustre service. I will not be using Air Berlin again.,0
"Brilliant flight as always and Emirates is known for its very comfortable flights. However, I truly feel that Emirates's standards have notched down a bit as the cabin crew are not that responsive to economy class passengers. Moreover, I had to ask for a glass of water about 5 times which is unacceptable according to Emirates standards. I am a frequent traveller of Emirates but this was not a good experience in terms of service provided. On the positive side, the seats were extremely comfortable and inflight entertainment was superb with movies from all over the world and very fine podcasts!",1
"We flew from Denpasar to Perth yesterday and will never fly this airline again. We checked in several hours before our flight and were disappointed to find that we had been given seats in two different rows (my husband and I were flying with our two kids). Obviously we had hoped to sit together as a family but thought ""oh well it's not the end of the world"". We boarded the plane and realised that we were not only in different rows but in 4 different seats. We were absolutely gob-smacked that an airline could put a 2 year old on his own! When we waved down the air hostess and explained that our son who had just turned two could not sit on his own she told us that the flight was full and we would have to take our dedicated seats. I told her that our 2 year old could not possibly sit on his own and she suggested that he sit on my lap instead. Pretty disappointing when you paid for 4 seats. Just when I thought things couldn't get much worse the food trolley came around and after placing my order for a hot meal for myself and my two kids I was told that they only accept cash and not card. I didn't have any cash on me (I had actually tried to withdraw cash at the airport but the ATM was out of order) so they told me I was unable to order any food. I said that there must be some other option as my kids were hungry and surely there was something they could do but they did not help at all. My poor kids basically spent the whole flight crying with hunger and they wouldn't even give me a bottle of water (as our water had been taken off us at the airport by security). I was basically in tears by this time and finally a kind passenger gave me $10 so I could buy something for the kids to eat. I will never fly with this airline again.",0
Booked an Air Canada flight to Vegas. I had no idea it was Rouge. Easily the worst flight very cramped no entertainment not even a cracker. The line up for the toilet went half way up the plane and you had to squeeze past people to get back to your seat! I will never fly Rouge again. Air Canada you have lost me.,0
LED-AMS. E-checking doesn't exist so 40-minute line at airport. Onboard almost no room between seats very claustrophobic. FAs are average with no charisma. Flights on time. Hot breakfast is probably the only plus of this airline.,0
BKK-RGN and return a few days later. Both flights left on time friendly cabin staff snack and hot drink served on a flight of just over 1 hour.,1
Just flown with Monarch outbound from Manchester to Faro on 17th November inbound on 24th. Both flights on time smooth flights even though the weather over the UK was atrocious. Great check-in boarding and onboard service leg room was a bit tight but overall good service.,1
7 hour delay from Manchester to Palma airport flight FR3441. Checked baggage in and no mention of delay 5 minutes later through security it stated on the flight boards delayed to 00.40 original flight time 17.35. No one at the airport to talk to only a phone at the help desk and then you could not get through. Eventually did speak to someone who did not explain the reason for the delay and explained that food vouchers would be given out at 20.30. Really poor customer service in my opinion. Hiding behind a telephone. Other families with very young children were told that the children under 5 not entitled to food vouchers. Do under 5s not eat and drink? Although this is a first for me with Ryanair the 10 hours we were actually stuck in the airport as no one would let you out was exhausting and for that reason along with the rubbish customer care I will never fly with them again. Avoid.,0
Durham to Bodrum return excellent fights on new aircraft. Good service much better than easyjet etc staff very nice and helpful. Drinks expensive but we knew they would be and took our own onboard.,0
Flew from Oslo to London. Check in and Seat Booking can be done on the net but only 22 hours before flying would be better if you could book your seat at the point of booking your flight. We managed to check in on the intent while we were in the hotel in Oslo. When we got to the airport to print our boarding passes the machines seem to all not really work we managed to spot a staff who helped us out by printing the boarding pass for us. We got to our gate and then had to wait communication was poor we were told that there was a delay to the flight only 15mins or so before the flight was supposed to take off staff were there earlier so I don't understand why this was not communicated earlier. Also they asked those with tickets numbers towards the back of the plane to board first however they did not seem to actually manage the situation if someone from the front row did board all the same so it did seem like only half a process was followed. Compared to Silk Air which does short haul flights around Asia this was a poor service compared to Easyjet and Ryanair this was a better service at least they bothered to clean the cabin a little before we boarded.,1
Phuket Air on the 25th March 2005 to a lovely holiday in Thailand. What turned out to be a nightmare was the return flight from Bangkok to Gatwick on the 9th April 2005. On arrival at Bangkok airport on the 26th March 2005 we were handed a sheet of paper and told to ring the number given 72hours before the flight was due to take off to reconfirm the flight and times. We took the flight tickets to an agent and ask if he would do the necessary for which he did it cost 200 baht to get this done we were told that all was in order and was even given a reference number which turned out to be totally ficticous. On arrival at Bangkok airport everything was total chaos as the flight had been cancelled but there was no one from Phuket Air to give any information out to us we were left to roam the airport ourselves to see if we could find anyone that knew anything about the cancelled flight. After several hours we were told that there was a bus waiting outside to take us to a hotel but once outside more chaos as we got on the bus with our luggage we were told that we would have to wait until the bus was full then it could leave. We waited and waited and waited two hours we sat on that bus even the police moved it on as it was there too long. We finally set off only to go round the ring road back to the airport. Still not a word from anyone at Phuket Air. Trying to phone Phuket Air but no answer or engaged. Trying to get home from Bangkok airport flying Phuket air since 9th April 2005 finally got home 14th April 2005. Anyone thinking of flying Phuket air should think again and go by a decent airline as Phuket air doesn't seem to care about it passengers just the money it can get from them.,0
A short flight between HND-GMP and the cabin crew made it as comfortable and pleasant as it can be. The food served for lunch was outstanding. It was one of the best meals I have had on board in the last few years. I am looking forward to traveling on long haul flights with Asiana next time.,1
TXL-FRA. Short flight on Airbus A321 from Berlin Tegel to Frankfurt hub for intercontinental flight. Once Berlin's new international terminal opens (eventually) these connections won't be needed. Boarding rather chaotic waited in aisle for passengers to get into seats airline should have started boarding rear seats first. Take-off delayed for technical reasons as well but once underway the pilot quickly made up time and the flight was fuss-free. FAs polite and smiled but time for only minimal food and drinks services on this short flight of less than an hour. Disembarking much faster.,1
"My wife and I flew NY-CPH in Dec 13 and return in Jan 14 and were very satisfied with SAS. Flights were on time (actually early). Cabin service was very professional and pleasant. Aircraft were standard Airbus but clean. We were in ""economy"" class so we didn't expect much. Food was ok with a nice beer/wine with dinner. I like the entertainment system especially the flight data.",1
People who complain about the fees and whatnot must not read before booking their flights. The site is very clear about the various fees all the way through the booking process. With the membership we saved a ton of money on our flight even with baggage fees and the extra fees to reserve big front seats it was still cheaper than flying a major airline even if we cashed in airmiles. As far as customer service goes we had no issues. Staff at Niagara airport were fine we had no issues and because it's such a small airport we got through check-in and security in record time. The flight itself was fine. There was a technical issue with the gate but even after having to switch gates we still departed on time. Big front seats are worth the extra money for sure. On the way home we had very friendly staff at Ft Lauderdale airport. There was an issue with the cleanliness of the plane on our return trip. Our seats weren't spotless but not gross but it seems that the cleaning crew didn't notice that someone had been sick in the row across from us. A passenger unfortunately put her hand in it while getting to her seat and had to go back out to the terminal to wash it off. The flight attendant was very sincere and concerned apologized to them and everyone in the area got the cleaning crew back in asap to take care of it sprayed some air freshener apologized again and again and had the passengers from that row seated in another row for the flight since there were some empty seats. It was unfortunate but the attendant handled it perfectly and we still left on time. The rest of the flight there were no issues. Even with major airlines I've almost always found garbage in the seat pocket that got missed it happens. Overall I would fly Spirit again but maybe not for a long flight. I recommend it if you want to save some money and don't care about inflight meals and movies (you can purchase snacks and drinks this is pretty typical of most airlines now anyway not many provide a free meal or snack these days). If you're a tall or heavy person definitely pay the extra for the big front seats. Generally speaking you get what you pay for. This is a discount airline so go in with low expectations and you'll be fine.,1
On May 12 2014 our flight from ORD to FCO was cancelled for weather related reasons. After 7 hours in the terminal we were told to go to a hotel or go home and come back for a 13.00 departure on May 13. We were told by the gate crew we would be reimbursed for cab fare or hotel fare and then had to go down and wait for our bags and then go through the whole check-in procedure the next day. Alitalia denied our request for reimbursement. While I understand weather is unavoidable I can't accept being lied to and shabby treatment. I think Alitalia could have handled this better especially since we had a 9.5 hour flight ahead of us with very little sleep. To add insult to injury there was a ground delay at ORD the next day which kept us on the tarmac for 2.5 hours after leaving the gate. By the way the seats were extremely uncomfortable.,0
Whereas they claim to be Europe's best airline their ground services are appalling. My flight TK60 on 19 November to Kuala Lumpur was supposed to have left at 00.55 was delayed 6 hours. I landed in Istanbul at 22.20 from Germany to avail of the connecting flight. It was a nightmare to be stuck in Istanbul airport to face their most unprofessional and rude ground staff. A meal voucher was handed to me around 2.00 as though they were doing me a big favor. I have found their ground staff from security personnel to customer service very rude. Most airlines depend more on their economy passengers for profit. The rude attitude towards their economy passengers mar their slogan of being a 4 star airline. I will avoid Turkish airlines in future.,0
"After being delayed 4 hours in Raleigh Durham I caught a flight to Baltimore and on to Kansas City. I sat in an aisle seat next to a large 300+ pound man. Obviously I leaned out into the aisle to accommodate for the gentleman. My feet never were in the aisle but my shoulder was. Throughout the 2.5 hour flight I was bumped progressively harder in my shoulder 8 times by the only female flight attendant on staff. Never once when she was walking towards me from the front. Always a fast paced bump to my shoulder as she walked past me in the other direction. Never once an ""excuse me"" or a turn around to see what she'd just hit. Seemed pretty intentional after the last one before landing in KC. Maybe she would be of more use loading bags somewhere away from others?",0
Ubon Ratchathani to Bangkok on B737 Service on ground and in air superb. Luggage a kilo or so ove but no problem. A bun sort of thing with sausage and water served in flight luggage waiting for me at Don Muang. I had more legroom on this plane than on my Thai flight on A330 from Australia. Recommend Nok Air to all.,1
CDG-VIE took this morning flight and it's so disappointing to see the standards drop so low. For breakfast if you don't drink Tea of Coffee it's Bread (croissant) and water no juice of any kind. Crew look suitably embarrassed. And you have for the inflight entertainment the reading of their Air France magazine. The paper cup and napkin is collected in a rubbish bag very quickly after serving and then the crew disappear. Virtually a low cost company.,0
First time have flown with Ryanair it was to Gran Canaria. Boarding cards easy to print out and able to pre book seats both ways. Plane was clean and plenty of leg room. Staff were very helpful during the flight. All in all will use Ryanair again. One thing the flight supervisors on both flights spoke far too fast it may be a small thing but very hard to understand.,1
Manchester (MHT) to Norfolk (ORF) Business select. Multiple children and elderly on the flight but it was vacation week. Flight took off late landed on time. I would not pay the 225% extra for the BS fare versus the wanna get away fare due to what you receive for that increase but work takes care of it as it is for business. The free drinks are nice even on short hops form BWI to ORF in BS. Only major complaint to Southwest Airlines do not board anyone ahead of Business select class unless they pay the same fare or please place them in rows 4 and up. When you pay $230 for Business select you should board the plane before anyone else especially if they only paid ~$89 for their ticket.,1
Travelled SW for the first time because my son gave me and my husband SW giftcards so we booked a trip to Vegas. We paid the extra $10. each was for early bird seating we got A section between 15 and 30 that was good. I think if you are flying as a couple it is worth the extra so you can sit together. I hear some people are saving seats for their partner which I find to be cheap. Anyway to and from Vegas we had good flights I liked choosing my seat. I will fly SW again as long as SW stays with limited extra fees. I used to fly Continental only but they have imposed more fees than I care to read about. Keep up the good work SW and we will stay loyal to you.,1
SYD-ADL. Quite pricey for the tickets as there are other hidden fees such as online booking fees and credit card fees which aren't included in the advertised price. Boarded the old and worn A320 about 45 minutes late and waited another 30 minutes before we began to taxi for take-off. No in-flight entertainment unless you want to pay money to rent an iPad. No leg room and zero recline. Arrived quite late and only got an apology from the flight stewardess which was nice. Overall not too bad for the price you paid but trust me there are better flights out there for just a few extra bucks.,0
Abu Dhabi to Prague. Since its a new flight the plane was half empty. Flight with a narrow body A319 crisp clean plane with nice new 2-2 seats. The flight was smooth crew courteous without being too invasive. Food delicious and plenty of drink rounds with water and juice. Seat pitch and legroom generous and flying with a smaller airline gave the flight a sense of privacy and not being in a plane crammed like a market place.,1
"NZ 879 CHC-OOL A320. Paid for ""works"". Awful (dry) food which lack any imagination water served in plastic cups no inflight magazine no sick bags no head phones so had to wait for them to arrive before I could use the entertainment system. The entertainment system had very limited selection of movies scrolling between screens was slow to navigate and the whole thing seemed counter-intuitive. When on Emirates you get an entertainment guide/magazine which allows you to view the selection of movies at a glance with Air NZ you need to slowly scroll through each page of movies. Hostesses rather than being professional were trying to be too friendly/familiar - the ""kiwi"" way does not automatically equate to being professional. Really poor work Air NZ regret using you.",0
SQ-318 SIN-LHR. Brand new B777-300ER new cabin in all classes including economy. Touch screen IFE Krisworld was amazing. Due dietary reasons I opted for fruit platters for both meals and they were great. Nice snacks between meals. Friendly cabin crew clean cabin.,1
Paris-Abu Dhabi-Melbourne first class. Paris to AUH no staff in first class cabin spoke French. Service was haphazard at best. Sink in main bathroom was blocked and this reported to crew. The same aircraft serviced the AUH-Melbourne sector. The sink was still blocked. This airline has some excellent staff however the standards are extremely uneven and one is left with the impression that training could be improved.,1
Outbound (from Southampton) was very good: easy check-in we liked the Jetstream experience and the cheery professionalism of the flight crew but Jersey-Southampton was a nightmare. Firstly 13.25 flight cancelled for 'technical' reasons. When offered a refund or rebooking we accepted seats on a later flight. This was a very stupid move because the 4 hour delay turned into a 7 hr 50 mins delay. If warned our Jetstream was bound to be the last flight out of the island at 20.15 we could have used the 7 hr 50 mins delay to catch a fast ferry. Given zero customer care and a total lack of honesty there is no way I would risk another flight with Blue Islands despite the professional flight crew the convenience of their new London City route and certainly not because of their pricing policy.,0
London to Dakar via Madrid and were pleasantly surprised with service and punctuality. We were due to return on 11 May and tried to do an online check in to get boarding passes. We succeeded to get boarding passes for Madrid to London but not the Dakar- Madrid leg. Because we knew that their website was generally dysfunctional we were resigned to show up at the airport in time for the flight. A friend suggested we call Air Europa via his friend at a travel agent. There aren't any telephone numbers shown on the site so it seemed a good idea. Only then did we discover that our flight was cancelled and that we had been transferred onto the Saturday 14th flight. Air Europa said they would not confirm this in writing but said we should just show up. As we are a 4 hour drive to the airport this is an unsettling situation.,0
"Here are the basics: flight delayed twice, no sign change put up at the gate, over 100 people waiting in line for over and hour, since the sign said it was boarding the entire time with no announcement. 25 People waiting in line to book a new connecting flight since the now delayed flight (which we had to figure out on our own) would make everyone miss their connection, we are not spoken to, rather told to board the plane with a ""50/50 shot you could rebook your connection in Dallas."" Get to Dallas, no flights until the next day, and we have to pay for our hotel room? What a wonderful way to end my vacation. Never again will my money go towards this airline or their partners.",0
Dreadful experiences with this airline - the day before leaving a person who only spoke French called and wanted to reroute us to a flight with a 6hr wait in Casablanca. The return flight was even worse - an antiquated aircraft had some technical problem in spite of which we were boarded and unboarded 90 minutes later. We were then trapped in the duty free airport zone no rep in sight most of the time people at the customer service desk (no English poor French) RAM staff treated us like dirt arrogantly refusing to give information. Passengers had to beg for meal vouchers but the airport cafe had only stale cheese bread rolls and quickly ran out of them.,0
IAD to CDG continuing on to DUB. A380 upper deck 62F. Seat is nice when sitting but for sleeping it is just dreadful. Not flat the headrest is apparently made of marble so your head actually hurts when you use their flat pillow to sleep and heaven help you if you are in the window and your seatmate is sleeping. The pitch is far too skimpy for comfort. Food and beverages are fine - although I don't understand why you have precisely two hot meal choices on an A380. The amenity kit is poor. The service was surprisingly friendly and good on this flight - I will give them that. CDG is the predictable mess - delays lack of information and the busses to shuttle you to connections so loved by Euro airports. When you have other options that have flat seats (Delta BA Brussels etc) and don't have to go through CDG I can't fathom why I would continue to take AF. On the bright side it was better than the last time I flew.,0
Bristol - Guernsey return. Wonderful Flights comfortable seats 2x2 enough leg room to remain comfortable for the short 55 minute approx. flights. Little delay on Outward journey but nothing to cause concern or interference with the trip. Usual sea fog caused return flight to have a delay of around 1 hour 20 minutes nothing anyone can do about natures elements and Sunday Maintenance of the aircraft has to meet States regulations. Return flight was as comfortable as the Outward journey staff equally friendly. Would not hesitate to recommend Aurigny to other travellers to the beautiful Channel Islands Good to see the airline growing and modernising since the States took it over. Only downside to Air Travel between Islands as in to do day trips to different Islands via plane is the horrendous Taxes and Fuel Surcharges which made any chance of us visiting the other Islands impossible on price which is a shame as other Islands lost out on tourist spending which is important to the economy of the Islands.,0
"The flight from Grand Rapids to St. Pete's was our first and our last with Allegiant. On our way down to Florida our flight was delayed 3 hours with no explanation other than ""mechanical issues"". When we arrived at our gate there were two cases of (warm) pop and one case of (warm) water. When we asked the gate agent when the incoming plane would be arriving he told us 30 minutes. Much to everybody's surprise there was a plane at the gate 5 minutes later. Upon boarding the plane our flight attendants showed their true colors and lack of professionalism of Allegiant Airline. They made light of the life preserver located under the seat in the event that ""the flight turns into a cruise"". That is not only an extremely unprofessional comment but it certainly did not sit well with an already anxious flyer. For our returning trip we arrived two hours ahead of our scheduled departure as instructed. When we attempted to check our bag we were kicked out of line along with everyone else on our flight because Allegiant could not ""handle"" us at that time. We waited another half hour before being allowed to re-enter the line to check our single bag. We hoped that was the worst we would have to deal with that day but sadly we were wrong. After boarding the aircraft we proceeded to sit on it for an hour and a half with no idea what was going on. Finally we were told that we would have answers within the next 5 minutes as to what the situation was and we didn't. We deboarded the plane and sat in the airport for an additional 2 hours. When I asked the gate agent what was going on I was told they didn't know and there was nobody that I could speak with to find out. I will never fly Allegiant again. Although they may appear to offer customers a deal the headache they inflict is not worth it. I strongly urge anyone considering to fly with them to reconsider.",0
EWR-HKG in Premium Economy and HKG-EWR in business (thanks to an unexpected upgrade). Had a great experience in both classes attentive but not too present service new airplanes clean friendly on time good connections in HKG (although I found their inter-connection with their subsidiary Dragonair not optimal) classy. Would definitely fly them again. Premium Economy product was good and definitely worth it on a 16hrs flight. While meals are close to those of economy if not the same the cabin quietness and space are enough to make this worth it. Business class was one of the best I've been in with attentive and not over-present service classy and providing you with the options you need when you want them for a pleasant and relaxing flight. Cathay definitely carried the magic of Hong Kong on their flights. Business class seating and bed is very good roomy and comfortable. A very good experience.,1
BHX-CFU-BHX 757-200 outbound 10th September. Had used online check in so baggage drop was swift and painless. Departed on time cabin clean and tidy cabin crew were friendly and helpful. Seats 31E and F so plenty of legroom although the seats did feel a little narrow. In flight meal good although the gluten free meal could be a little more imaginative. Flight arrived a little early. In bound flight 17th September same aircraft and seats departed on time. Meals good and cabin crew as good as the outward journey flight arrived a little early. All in all a pleasant experience and one I would be happy to repeat.,1
LHR-TAS. My experience with this airline has been OK. They seem to keep to the flight times reasonably well at least out of Tashkent. There are some problems with the cabin crew - using mobile phones during take off being one example. A real issue I have with them is the chaotic check in at LHR. The last two times at LHR the queue has filled one end of terminal 2 and takes 2-3 hours to get through. The flight is typically delayed by an hour because of this.,0
I just arrived back from Singapore this morning. SIN-SYD on an A330-300 in business class. Tickets were purchased with frequent flyer points so value for money not relevant. The seat was comfortable and folded down into a flat bed. The staff were cheerful happy and always ready to help with anything. Seeing as it was an overnight flight I didn't have any food or use the entertainment system but I had a quick flick through to see what they had and the movie/TV selection wasn't nearly as extensive as other airlines such as Singapore. We left early and arrived early.,1
"Check-in smooth, Priority Security Line, excellent new Preludium Lounge at Warsaw Airport, one of the nicest loungest I've seen. Boarding on time. Quite old A320, with only 1.5 rows of Business Class. No welcome drink, but newspapers and magazines offered, Italian only. After take off - hot towels and meal, which was horrible. From an  Italian airline I'd expect great Italian food and wines, but I got some mushroom salad with ""feta""-like cheese and hot cottage cheese mixed with tomato sauce - inedible. There was no choice of wines, only one kind of each, I took red, but again, poor quality. Except wine glass on a tray, all other drinks were served in a plastic cup. After dinner, grappa and limoncello was served, again in plastic, but limoncello was too strong for my taste. Cabin crew was very nice and perfectly groomed, but food was disaster. No inflight magazine available in any seat pocket, only old and damaged shopping catalogue. Not recommended.",0
"LOS-IST-TLV. One word: Terrible. B737-900 LOS-IST. No air conditioning at LOS airport and drinks are not allowed into gate. By the time you board most passengers are very thirsty. Requests for water were shrugged off with the response ""later"". How can you refuse water to thirsty passengers. After take off painfully slow dinner service and a small plastic cup with water served. Of course it's not enough. Again FA would not supply more water. I even went to the galley pointed at a full bottle of water and asked for some. Again I was told to return to my seat water will come later. I approached the inflight manager to complain and situation improved. Poor English by pilots and FA's couldn't understand any announcements. No soap in toilets with nothing to dry wet hands on. Smiles from the crew were out of the question. Food was ordinary can't understand where all the fuss about their food in Economy class comes from. Maybe from flights outside Africa. Flight to TLV slightly better crew all in all cant judge all flights they operate but for me it was the last time on TK.",0
I flew from London Luton to Bucharest and back and I had one of the most awful experiences. It was impossible to receive an itinerary per email. Secondly the cabin was extremely hot until the plane was in the air. Even the stewards were using the magazines as a fan. Most important on the flight back we were allowed at check in to take our hand luggage onboard but at the gate they weighed it and didn't allow us to get on the flight until paying 50 euros for 3 kg overweight on one of the bags. We reduced it to 1.5kg and still didn't allow us. Instead of weighing it at check in before security they left it on purpose to do it at the gate. Moreover they said it's 50 euros but took 250 RON Selected seats that we paid for were already given to someone else as well and we had to get others. Luckily were quite early at the check in so we got only one row further but if we were late we would have received even worse seats. The crew had no clue where we will get our bags whether at the airplane steps or with the rest of the luggage. Hugely disappointing experience and I would never recommend them.,0
Johannesburg to Ho Chi Minh City return via Hong Kong. 3/7/2014 - 19/7/2014. Flight was delayed and caused missing connecting flight. Delayed me by over 24 hours. Ground staff were rude and unhelpful. Customer service that I contacted when I eventually got home were not much better. Will never fly Cathy Pacific again.,0
"My wife and I have just returned from Brisbane airport. Twice today I was contacted by phone confirming that we were on our ""booked"" business class flight to London. When we arrived at the airport we were told that we had been bumped off the flight. There seemed to just be random people chosen. About 8 of us were in the same boat. No taxi voucher was given for us to return home and no future booking made. Very poor public relations.",0
ISB-MAN. I was travelling on Pakistan International Airlines and was disappointed with the meals served. On the flight we were served two breakfasts. Many passengers asked cabin crew and they replied in a unprofessional manner that we have changed our system now and do it for all flights.,0
I've flown all over the world frequently for more than 20 years. I'm sorry to say that my experience with Air Transat is the worst I've met. The flights took place on 27 August and 16 September 2013 Amsterdam - Vancouver v.v. In my opinion it's a crime to put so many rows in an airplane with seats so narrow that now a week later I still suffer from a sore shoulder and right arm. The back of my seat couldn't be moved in any direction. Alas the one of the passenger in front of me could so when she did which she did during 9 hours my face being 20cm from her seat. My seat itself was tilted slightly forwards so it felt like gliding off it all of the time. About the food I will not bother you it was hardly edible. Never again.,0
Had a business class flight from Milan to Lisbon (1/10/13) was very nice. The cabin crew were friendly and always helped. The food was good for airline meals. Very efficient serving. No problem with the luggage. Got back to Zurich on 9/10/13 again business class. Very nice service as described before always refilled the glasses. The priority luggage is always the first which comes out. I always travel with TAP when I go to Portugal they still maintain a certain high lever which is very satisfactory.,1
DOH-CPH-DOH-SGN on 18 Dec and 29-30 Dec. 2014. All flights on time. B787-800 DOH-CPH-DOH on B787-800 and A330-200 on the DOH-SGN leg. Food good but much less and of slightly deteriorating quality as compared to previous flights. FA?s professional hard working coping and caring despite the flights were full. Economy on 787 is nothing above normal seats are cramped and exit seats cannot always decline. Gold-tier members recognised in economy (2 out of 3 times). Champagne made available on all flights. Bus-transfers in Doha still frequent and tedious and constitute anti-climax on otherwise spotless trips. New Al Mourjan lounge in Doha huge impressive but lacks personality decorations and toilets. Meals on order.,1
IXE-BOM-DEL on Boeing 737-800. Both legs on-time was assisted by ground staff at Mumbai as it was a tight connection: so could do away with another security check. Food however was below average: Air India scores in this respect. Cabin crew attentive. Overall recommended.,1
Flew Business Class Melbourne to Denpasar and returned 2 weeks later (flights GA719 and GA718). Was accompanied by my wife (we are in our sixties) adult daughter and her 2 year old son. Flight out was good - ground staff flight crew food entertainment were excellent. Flight back was the exact opposite - 1) spent too long waiting for a delayed flight in the very poor Garuda Business lounge in Denpasar airport. Massively overcrowded and poor facilities. 2) Gate was changed without notice from one close to where we were to Gate 9 at the other end of the airport. Wasn't even announced in the Bus Lounge. 3) after significant hassle with a pram and a 2 year old we eventually reached the Gate to find boarding had commenced (again no announcement). 4) at the Business lane gave the attendant our documentation. He did process that quickly but immediately let other passengers through (both Business and Economy). We were trying to get the stroller checked into the hold pacify a crying toddler at 11.30 at night and get our hand luggage together. People were allowed to almost trample us! Has to very loudly object in order to get some understanding and a bit of consideration. 5) Flight staff were poor did not circulate for drinks meals were poor. 6) on the overnight flight despite valiant attempts none of us managed to get the seat into a comfortable sleeping position. Never again.,0
Travelled Economy LHR-MIA and return in February 2015 on board a 747. Good check-in both sides quick efficient and friendly.No longer supply sparkling wine with a meal. Who on earth is providing their in flight meals it was appalling. Do the management actually try it. I know that to many a Â£500+ return is not big money but surely it is not beyond their wit to provide the passenger with something edible. The cabin crew were as always delightful. I think we will give them a miss for a while in the hope of some improvement.,0
HKG-Hanoi economy. Delayed flight (as is normal) by about 30 minutes and rather chaotic boarding as economy all told to line up separately- to get onto the same bus as premium. Onboard crew do dinner drinks etc in a short time. Flight menu also given in French English and Chinese before trolley reaches you.,1
San Francisco to Copenhagen on the new route. You could see that the plane was old and the Entertainment system was old! Seats were good. The food was good and the personnel friendly. The stewardess told me when I was getting my free drink with my food that there wouldn't be anything to drink before the last meal 8 hours later so if I wanted it I could get another drink so I got 2 cokes. I have been on most airlines between Europe and USA and SAS was definitely one of the better. I will definitely fly SAS again.,1
OR365 27/2/14. OR366 13/3/14. We flew from Amsterdam to Bonaire in March 2014. The flight itself was ok but for the price we paid we expected better food and drink than we received. For the 10 hour overnight return flight we waited 2 hours for a small dinner (without drinks service in between) including one tea/coffee/juice. That was it! The only other drinks service was in the morning (2 hours before landing while most people were still asleep) where we had to pay for tea or coffee! We also had to pay extra for the Entertainment system which had a very poor selection.,0
BKK-KUL BKK-HKT (two times) BKK-URT-BKK BKK-CEI-BKK. Flight was nice cabin crew helpful and responsible price cheap compared to other airlines. I would recommend them.,1
I live in London . I agree with all the negative points said by the people in the comments and I would like to add that it is impossible for people to get through the phone to contact Air Algerie agency in order to book or to buy a ticket - and if we make a booking through internet we don't get an answer that the booking has been accepted or not !,0
IB 3539 May 25 MUC-MAD. May 30 MAD-MUC. Most uncomfortable seats I have had: Very low space and even worse: Their metal fixing to the floor and the cage for under seat luggage prevented every movement of my legs and shoes. No free beverages even no water.,0
Flew from Reykjavik to Gatwick on A320 11/2/2015. First class service friendly polite crew very attentive to passengers and all crew were happy. Flew with Icelandair to Reykjavik much prefer Wow Air.,1
"The flights themselves were reasonable value especially for late booking but don't believe their promise that ""in case of train or flight service disruption OpenSkies guarantees to book you on the next flight or train available. And offer you a hotel stay if necessary."" When my TGV from Lyon had engine trouble and arrived too late for the flight to IAD OpenSkies staff at ORY rudely repudiated these ""guarantees"". I was refused a seat on the only other flight to EWR because I was a ""no show"" although the train had been arranged by the airline itself my ""one and only"" contact. I was told that if I wanted to buy another ticket I'd have to do so by phone since ""we are not OpenSkies we are acting for OpenSkies."" I finally got through to a supervisor in Paris and was ""permitted"" to board the Newark flight but the only guarantee I got was that OpenSkies would take no responsibility for getting me back to Washington.",0
First time flying on Tiger and we flew from the Sunshine coast to Melbourne return I was impressed with the contact and confirmation via email price $59.00 each way (booked 4 months earlier). Service attendants friendly nature cleanliness of the planes and departure time (only 10 minutes late both ways ). The seating is fine we were lucky to be seated in the emergency exit for the first flight snack variety and price as per normal low cost airlines I would recommend Tiger and with the option of flying from either Brisbane or the Sunshine Coast have a great advantage of finding a cheap fare to Melbourne.,1
AMS-SVO check in opens 2.5 hrs before long lines online check in was not possible. Flight boarded on time it was a A321 instead of the scheduled A320 due to high volume booking as elite plus we were lucky to be upgraded which was a very pleasant surprise. Welcome drink amenity set and a 2x2 configuration. After take off received a nice hot lunch and a drink but the remaining 2 hours no service quite odd. For business seats for European business good service should be better. DIGI player was good for a 3.5 hr flight.,1
LHR-BKK-LHR. Service has been improving over the years although this time I had a prolonged and embarrassing argument with check-in staff about overweight cabin baggage. I'm a vegan and have suffered from the dreadful Chinese veggie dishes they used to serve up. But recently the food has greatly improved with non Chinese vegan dishes and huge helpings of fresh fruit. Excellent espresso coffee. Cabin staff pretty faultless. Boeing 777-300ER is an excellent plane. The big seats are fine for sitting and relaxing. My only gripe is with the fixed distance video screen which inconveniently lies mid-way between the focus of my distance and reading glasses so the films are always a bit blurred! I like EVA's BKK-LHR schedule which leaves around 1pm. Much better than BA Qantas and Thai that leave in the middle of the night.,1
Flew from St. Maarten to JFK New York. An announcement came over the loud speaker asking if anyone wanted an upgrade. I mistakenly thought that meant an upgrade to first class. So I paid an extra $150 for my children and I to upgrade only to find out that I paid $150 for approximately a foot and a half extra leg room. I would have never spent my hard earned money on that and I believe that should've been explained to me. I will never fly jetBlue again.,0
Business class from LHR to DEL Dec 2012 return. No complaints - all staff and crew were helpful. Plane was a new 777 and seats were very comfortable with a lot of legroom. The inflight entertainment had a good choice of English and Indian films. My only gripe is the lack of an Air India lounge for Business Class passengers at IGI airport in Delhi. It's unacceptable to send your premium passengers to a regular cafe with poor quality food and no WiFi where the staff are trying to charge you for anything they can get away with. Please Air India stop using Cafes at IGI and get yourselves a proper business class lounge with WiFi decent food and drink.,1
Stockholm to Newark. Staff friendly and attentive as is often the case with SAS - might not be over the top but I think they are pretty consistent nowadays in my experience. Seats and layout are still the old one which is starting to show its age. IFE is nothing to write home about so keen to see what the 2015 upgrade will look like. Seats are still surprisingly comfortable but they are not full-flat. Food and service is very good though and I think they have done a great job on drinks selection. For the main meal I had a very nice salmon starter followed by an good chicken dish and a nice selection of cheese for dessert. The light 2nd meal was a shrimp salad with a mango cheesecake. Overall very good. Flight was slightly delayed from Stockholm but they gain back time in the air so landed early at Newark. SAS provides a pretty solid if ageing business class service from Stockholm to the US. Not necessarily top ranking but when convenience is taken into account this is a good choice.,1
"If Spirit Airlines were the last remaining airline on the planet I would not fly them. After booking a flight on Kayak.com that appeared to show a very good fare I arrived at the airport and discovered Spirit was going to gouge my travelling companion and me for $90 each way simply for checking or carrying on a bag - something that was never disclosed prior to reaching the airport. The plane was late cramped and customer service was awful - the only informative thing the flight attendant had to say was ""don't worry the seats don't recline"". This dreadful airline is the worst flying experience I've ever had and from the conversations other passengers on the flights had it doesn't appear anyone will fly with them again.",0
Round trip from Los Angeles to Oslo was on SK's flight from Newark to Oslo and from CPH back to Newark. Flight crew was not engaged or pleasant in anyway but they did their job as required. Food was not good my children refused to try (it looked like meatloaf). On the EWR-OSL leg experienced a very hot trip probably in the mid 90's F. The couple across the aisle complained to crew at least 5 times to no effect. On the CPH-EWR flight only the lleft side of headphones worked and on the seatback touchscreen after about a half an hour half the screen stopped working. It started working after it was off for about 15 minutes but then half a hour later half the screen shut off again. Gave up after going through routine 2x's.,0
"Manchester - Marsa Alam 06/11/12 return 20/11/12. No premium economy cabin available on either flight. Suffered nearly six hours in unbelievable cramped conditions as far too many seats are crammed into the aircraft. Situation made worse when passenger in front of me decided to ""fully"" recline his seat further reducing what little space I had. Warm wine with tasteless microwaved panini was very expensive. In flight entertainment non existent. Cabin crew on return flight considered far from ""friendly"" saving any smiles for disembarkation.",0
CZ 322 Melbourne to Guangzhou - London 23/6/13. Never again. On boarding only Chinese morning newspaper available. Asked for whiskey or other spirit. Told there were no spirits. They gave me a beer (finally). It was a warm beer with a glass of ice to accompany. Wife asked for coffee. It was colder than the beer. When she asked for sugar they did not have any on the carry tray. Entertainment was about 6 movies and 6 TV shows. No music channel. The cabin crew could not speak English despite leaving from Melbourne. Very disappointed.,0
I have now been flying with Aegean since they took over the Olympic slots at Heathrow. This year on the morning of October 7th Heathrow was fog bound so the flight to Athens was delayed by two hours. This meant missing the evening flight to Mykonos. As soon as I was checking in their staff were most helpful. On arriving at Athens I was put up in Hotel Sofitel everything paid for and caught the flight to Mykonos the following morning. My only thought is that the evening flight to Mykonos is too tight with the London flight around about an hour and needs looking in to. Aegean is an excellent airline as part of my holiday flew with them to Crete as well all flights were full and I look forward to flying with them next October.,1
Luxair is a full-service airline that still serves sandwiches and champagne even in economy class. The flight attendants are always smiling and extremely friendly. They have some problems with online check-in which does not work in 90% of all cases but I would not hesitate to recommend Luxair and I would prefer them over almost every other European airline.,1
AKL-HCMC cancelled the flight for no reason. Assured me that I would be on the next day's flight. The next day there was no record of me and I was told the flight was full. Spent 3 hours with many angry people trying to sort it out. On my return they cancelled my Hanoi - HCMC flight so I lost a day and both ends of my trip. Customer service was awful.,0
2 weeks ago my husband and I went to New Zealand. For years we travelled with Air Canada or Air New Zealand and this last time we made a big mistake and decided to fly with United. We prolonged our arrival to Auckland by a few good hours but we would co-op with these extra hours had it not be for the awful time on the flight to and from Auckland. The disrespect and disregard to it's passengers is shameful. There is no room for peoples' legs. This is a very long flight and airlines need to consider peoples' health as well. The food was awful. Cold and not edible. The flight attendants were beyond rude. I was shocked when 2 of them who could not decide if the liquid in the pots are tea or coffee simply removed the lids and put their noses in. People stared in disbelief. However when we got to Sydney Australia we embarked on an Air New Zealand flight to Auckland. What a huge difference. All of the sudden we could stretch our legs. The food was edible and the flying attendants were courteous. Going back home to Canada the experience repeated itself. We flew Air New Zealand to Sydney and everything was good and then hell repeated itself when we had to embark Untied from Sydney to Canada. My husband and I decided that never again will we fly United. Our son who was wiser flew Air New Zealand and he mocked us for choosing United. They are bad news to the rest of the carriers on star alliance. Life is a school and we learned our lesson the hard way.,1
LTN-BUD-LTN. I was very unfortunate to try and travel with this airline for a one-night family visit to Hungary. Flight delayed almost 7 hours. 3 completely different types of information given by arrogant ground crew misleading passengers. Refusing to take any responsibility and giving an 8 pound voucher Wizzair has declared the situation solved. An additional issue was a drunk passenger admittedly not the airline's fault who had to be taken off the plane adding another 45 min to the delay. I was 'lucky' just to travel to BUD but many people with small children wanted to travel onwards but with no option at 00.30 am. Wizzair did not have any solution ready for these passengers.,0
BKK-MNL-BKK. Booked online with no hassle on using foreign credit or debit cards. Efficient and trouble-free check-in in both BKK and MNL T2 with a decent 30kg baggage allowance. Both flights on time. Cabin Crew were efficient with a basic but delicious hot meal service. I've had worse food on Business Class on some airlines. Both flights were pretty full which shows PAL are doing something right. Genuine improvements in the airline who are trying hard to be the airline they need to be in today's marketplace. I'll use them again.,1
KUL-JED-KUL MH150 and MH151. It was a fantastic trip for me and my family. The cabin crew were very friendly and attentive. The food were delicious. The IFE also very good with many choices of movies. I will definitely fly with Malaysia Airlines again in the future.,1
JMK-ATH-LHR. A3 377/A3 608 7 Aug 2014. Mykonos - Athens sector operated by Olympic Air Dash 800 aircraft. Clean inside and out and welcomed on board by very polite cabin crew. Only 2 Flight Attendants for a 20 minute flight. Departed on time and despite the fact that it was such a short flight a full drink service was offered with a variety of soft drinks napkins ice and a bag of peanuts and everyone was served. Upon landing in ATH the goodbye and thanks you greeting was polite with a smile. An excellent flight. 3 hour layover at Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport Athens was a breeze. Was given an invite to the Aegean Business Lounge on the A side of the departure terminal which was comfortable with the usual drinks and snacks available and regularly topped up. Nice clean lounge with a view of both runways. ATH-LHR Aegean Business. Departed ATH with 15 minute delay clean Airbus A321-200 aircraft. Good PA announcements by Purser and Captain. Comfortable leather seats with middle seat free. Drink service and peanuts after take off with hot towel service. Menu was provided with a choice of 2 hot main meals of chicken or swordfish with a delicious salmon entree and a selection of delicious Greek desserts. A good choice of wines including award winning Greek varieties plus the usual soft after dinner and a good selection of teas and coffees. Hot towel service again before landing. Landed on time. A very impressive service offered by Aegean. Have no hesitation about using them again.,1
We flew with from Madrid to San Jose and from Miami to Madrid this month and were very disappointed by the service the comfort and the general attitude of the staff. Travelling with my husband we asked at check in to be sat together we were assured we were sat next to each other. We did not check at the time but found out that we were in opposite side of the plane. The plane is far from being great only a few screens depending on where you are sat you can hardly see the screen. The air hostesses are very unfriendly and not helpful. They hardly speak any English. Very bad experience I usually don't put much importance on the airline we fly with but would avoid Iberia by all mean from now on. Also lost the luggage on the way to San Jose got them 2 days later luckily.,0
Flew with them for the first time from Dublin to New York. Plane out was delayed by 3 and a half hours because the cover for one of the emergency exit lights was missing! We were told for 1 hour that the delay was due to the ongoing servicing of the plane then they finally admitted what the problem was. It took over an hour for a new plastic cover to be sourced and a further hour to get the cover and get us onboard. Then on the way back we were 2 hours delayed because the plane we were getting had been sitting in a different terminal all day and had to be brought over to our gate. God forbid they might plan ahead and get the plane over earlier so that we actually took off on time!,0
Disgusting service. Had a 9.5 hour flight to UK from Vegas and were given one glass of water complimentary for the whole duration. Everything else you had to pay for unless you had booked a package holiday which included food and drinks. Staff were extremely rude and incompetent. My boyfriend and I were given seats miles apart. When we questioned this at the gate we were told there were no other seats and there was nothing they could do (even after I had told them how difficult I find flying alone). The lady said they had seated us as close as possible but when we got on the flight there was a row completely empty which we eventually got moved to when we asked again. Entertainment system was broken for most of our flight and when it did work it the quality was awful. Seats were uncomfy the blankets and pillows smelt horrible and there was dirt down the side of the wall. We were charged to use headphones adapters and even our credit card. Next time I will pay the extra flight money for some decent service.,0
Shanghai Pudong-Taipei Taoyuan return on B747-400 excellent experience with CI arrival/departure on time only 1.5 hrs flight but got full meal and beverage service. AVOD with touch screen and lots movies cabin crew very friendly. Definitely will fly with CI again.,1
VA 193 PER-HKT 1 Sep 4 hour delay with no explanation apart from Operational. Old plane no inflight entertainment unless you download. Not every one has a tablet or want to take a laptop on holidays. Really cramped seating in row 23. VA 192 HKT-PER 10 Sep sat further forward and better leg room inflight service good. Plane nothing special. Not what I was expecting from the looks of their website. Would much rather fly on Air Asia. You know what you are getting then. Not able to purchase Duty Free at Phuket airport as VA have all sorts of extra bag checks even after you and your bags have been through X-rays twice.,0
AI 55 Kochi to BOM. Fully packed late night flight on time decent dinner and decently well looked after for a short flight. Polite crew. Will fly again.,1
We are flying from Birmingham to Albany. Before deplaning we learned there is an hour delay for our 2 hour layover in Baltimore. We are not surprised as my husband had a 2 hr delay from Albany to Jackson a few days ago my sister in law had a 2 hr delay flying from DC to Panama City and we were delayed 3 hrs flying from LaGuardia in our layover in Nashville. If you want to get anywhere on time I would suggest a different airline. We have almost a full day of list time in delays and have been offered no apologies and no compensation. This is our vacation time and we work hard all year for it it is valuable family time and we've paid richly to be robbed of it. I will never fly Southwest again.,0
"We were delayed for 2 and a half hours on a Barcelona to Amsterdam flight. This delay incurred unforeseen additional costs in the airport departures area. Buying food and drink is expensive when the kids say they are hungry. Onboard the ""operational excuse"" apology for the delay was brief (technical problems). Then the cabin crew quickly got on with the more important business of selling expensive drinks and food to tired and delayed passengers. The 3 hr rule means that compensation is not possible in this case. I will contact Transavia to determine why a courtesy goodwill drink is not offered to passengers in these circumstances.",0
Singapore to Krabi and return. I arrived at the Budget Terminal at 915 am for the 1025 am flight. There were still a line of about 10 to 15 people waiting to be checked in at the two counters that were open. After a ten minute wait we were checked in. Despite not reserving a seat in advance we were allocated a complete row of six seats. The flight was about 85% full. We boarded about 15 minutes before flight time. It was drizzling and we were offered an umbrella for the short walk to the stairs to board the aircraft. On board the seats were leather-covered. There was a five minute delay in push back and we took off at 1045 am. Once air-borne the crew began buy on board service and well as duty free sale. Service was fuss free and it was a short 80 minute ride to our destination. We landed five minutes behind schedule and proceeded for our holiday. For the return flight we arrived at 1015 am at Krabi Airport for the 1135 am flight. There were queues at the two counters opened for check in. We waited about ten minutes before it was our turn. The flight was full but the agent managed to offer us 6 aisle seats that were not too far from one another. The aircraft arrived about fifteen minutes late from Singapore and that delayed our departure from Krabi as well. Service on board was similar to the inbound flight. Nothing much to expect nor complain about. Just a clean smooth journey back to Singapore. For regional trips in and from Asia Tiger does the job fine and provides affordable point to point service most of the time.,1
"Booked a vacation to Jamaica through Air Canada Vacation. The both Rouge flights were the worst experience. No room for legs outdated video entertainment narrow aisle between cramped 3x3 rows all two washrooms at the end of the plane. According to CBC ""Rouge seats on the Airbus 319-100 have 73.5 cm of pitch compared with 79-89 cm on the same aircraft on a regular Air Canada flight"" and that is true! Quite bad business decision Air Canada leadership made. I will make every effort not to fly with Rouge ever more even if I have to change my trip destination.",0
Hong Kong - Beijing vv on Airbus 320 as an extension of CX trip from Sydney. Being a sister airline of CX the standard was consistent with CX. On the trip to Beijing the cabin was so hot that passengers keep fanning themselves. Flight attendants spoke English Mandarin and Cantonese. Chose pork inedible. Other options all right. Quantity meagre in meals. Turbulent flights. Timing very unfriendly arrived in Beijing at 01.55 return trip left at 02.50 plane delayed until 03.30. No direct air bridge to aircraft bussed to and from aircraft.,1
TG 561 from Hanoi to Bangkok on June 28th. Staff performance is low they seemed to be very stressed since the flight was full due to summer holiday. Food was bad and cold. Alcohol drinks only on request. They were stressed if you asked for immigration applications. No inflight entertainment. Even though we came in on an A330 we had to stop at a parking position on the field and be taken by bus to the terminal. They built an airport for 45 Mil. guests/year and we have to travel by bus.,1
Oslo to JFK on 10th April 2014. After booking tickets on the Dreamliner aircraft which they promote we ended up on an old airbus which was dreadful to say the least. Norwegian held this fact back about the aircraft until the last minute. It was overbooked which caused a huge problem. They tried to offer an inducement of 200 euros which not many people went for. Therefore people we made to take a flight the next day. These people had bags already checked in and these had to be taken off the flight before we took off. This took time and in the process a panel door on the a/c was damaged. Overall it was over 2 hours before we took off. In this time we were sat on the plane without even being offered water. During the flight which was operated by hifly crew who seemed out of their depth. There was an old entertainment system but no headsets. The WI Fi was non existent. Therefore we watched and did nothing for 8 hours. The food which I pre-bought never came and we had no choice of what was eventually given. My seat was broken. In a nutshell don't fly with Norwegian.,0
CGK-SIN-CGK. The seat was terrible with very little leg room the FA's disappeared during the flight no presence at all and the toilet was dirty. On the way back to Jakarta the air conditioner was extremely cold however the mood lighting gave a little comfort and that was the only positive thing I took from the flight.,0
This is my first time on Ethiopian airlines and was impressed. The Route from LAX to Dublin is new and just started in June 2015. I was hesitant when booking but the fares were extremely good. The flight attendants were wonderful and I was impressed by their professionalism and concern for the passengers needs and comfort. The food and drink was very good. The plane being a new 787 Dreamliner was immaculate and this is the fastest flight I have had to Dublin. The direct route from LAX to DUB definitely filled a void since Aer Lingus pulled out several years ago. I would recommend this airline. The prices are reasonable and the service is fantastic. The hours of this flight are a little odd leaving LAX around midnight. The Dublin flight leaves for LAX at 6.15 am. If you can deal with those hours then this airline is the way to travel. No more flying 5 plus hours to the east coast laying over for hours and then having another 7 hour journey ahead. Our flight time was a little over 9 hours to Ireland.,1
Check in was rapid in Marrakech. We were allowed 2 suitcases of 23 kg each. Entertainment was OK during flight. Food was OK. The fish was good. My hungry wife asked for a second meal. The arm rests of our seats were falling apart and glued with some glue that did not work. The staff were friendly. We flew Marrakech-Casablanca-Montreal.,1
I flew Air from Sydney to Delhi and return because it was a non stop flight. On entering the aircraft it looked old and I found that my touch screen did not work. The toilets were disgusting smelt and were stained. Some panels were hanging loose. The floor was awash. On return the aircraft looked newer but the toilets were still disgraceful. I had to fly via Melbourne which was a pain in the neck as we had to disembark in Melbourne and go through a stringent security check again. On take off the cabin crew did not do a safety check of passengers and we took off with one passenger asleep across three seats unrestrained. One passenger had tray table down and that was what I could see from my seat. The cabin crew avoided eye contact at all times. During the long overnight flight from Delhi children were allowed to run amok. Food mediocre. Would never use again.,0
Traveled DFW-NRT over Christmas break in 2012. Old 777-200 but the cabin was maintained pretty well and clean. Boarded last because of a late connection whisked into an almost empty first class. Food service was quick and good the steak I ordered was surprisingly good. An old flight attendant turned out to be a very funny and nice man who did everything to make the flight better and knew when to leave me alone (sleeping). Personal TV screen was not of the highest quality but personal none the less and thus enjoyable. Lay flat seat worked just fine and the ability to swivel and work on a desk was a plus. Calm flight except for circling for 30 mins before landing at Narita.,1
My wife and daughter flew out the day after Christmas (2013) and arrived 2 hours prior to boarding as recommended. Much to our surprise the line to check baggage was extremely long compared to what the other airlines were experiencing. It was apparent that Frontier was under staffed behind the counters so by the time it was our turn to check in the gate was closed for our flight. They did not have an express check in so we were out of luck as this would have helped. Fortunately a relative gave us her miles for my wife and daughter to fly on Delta and after explaining to the Delta representative what had happened they were given priority check in and they were on a flight 3 hours later to their destination. After numerous phone calls with waits of up to 1 1/2 hours Frontier gave us vouchers for the fight that was missed. We have always had great experiences with Frontier over the years but apparently with all the reorganizations buyouts etc.. have lost the customer service they once had.,0
JFK-CDG-VIE. The AF Prem Econ seats are as described elsewhere uncomfortable. They weren't designed for sleep. Our return flight from CDG to JFK was on an Airbus 380. I moved us to the front 2 seats at the emergency exit and we had plenty of room. The toilet kit and 'coronet' were appreciated as well as the wine and cognac. The food was nothing great. I tried to purchase upgraded meals for our return flight but the AF website never seemed to get me there. Check-in was always expedited. All the AF personnel we encountered were friendly and professional.,1
"Air Calin AKL-NOU (originally also NOU-AKL as well - but they decided to go on strike). Apart from boarding the aircraft (a beautiful A330) and waiting around an hour for who knows what reason as all passengers were seated and ready for some tropical sunshine and French culture which awaited us 3 hours away it was a pleasant and well done flight. My Kosher meal was bought to me before take off so I could ""break the seal"" and it could be heated up for me - the meal was nice but lacked presentation and creativity of everyone elses meals - which looked and smelt divine. The FA's all very well groomed and with mediocre manors were to some extent inhibited with their english skills which were good but just hidden behind shyness. The seats were very comfortable excellent PTV entertainment with each movie in four languages and at least 6 options + games - too much for a less than 3 hour flight. The inflight mag was also good but there wasn't much in the way of newspapers. Very scenic approach to Noumea - however I was a bit concerned about one of the stewardess' continuing a conversation with a passenger she obviously knew for half the flight (not actually doing any thing else after the meal was served) and continuing it until about 20 seconds to touch down - way after the announcement had been made to be seated. Tantouta airport is not made to handle a full A330 on a summer day it felt like there was no air con and the lines were horrendous - made worse with another wait for our bags. Customs was very relaxed though...as was any laws regarding smoking. Coming home was a bit of a feat. We turned up at the airport at 5 am after being told that there was only one previously delayed flight going to AKL due to a flight attendant strike or something along those lines. We were put up in a rat hotel by the airport by Air Calin until 1am in the morning when we were all shuttled back to the airport to check in etc (more lines) and a few hours later find out that our rescue ride home hadn't even left NZ yet - more waiting in one of the least entertaining airports in the world. Finally our air NZ plane arrived (on which my boarding pass was labelled with KSML yet did I get one - pity as I was looking forward to the far more entertaining Air Calin to carry me home and end my French Fling in my favourite holiday destination with a French Flair and decent service!",0
I'm a frequent traveler hopping on planes every couple of weeks for U.S. domestic and European travel and my recent experience flying Turkish Airlines from Istanbul to JFK is the worst flight experience I have had. It started with not being able to contact the airline on the day of the flight to confirm the flight time on March 30th a day that Europe moved to daylight saving time but the Turkish government for some odd reason decided to delay the switch for twenty-four hours at the last minute. Next a surly person at the Turkish Airline check-in counter followed by a lengthy delay for takeoff due to the computer-automated baggage system being down. On the flight my travel companion and I were separated by the flight crew to accommodate a family that wanted to be seated together. We repeatedly told them we were traveling together he was moved to economy plus/business with plenty of seats around him but they refused to move me. So on an eleven-hour flight I ended up with no one to chat with. Finally the plane was full of toddlers and clearly the flight crew was having difficulty keeping the bathrooms clean and the cabin ended up smelling awful for the last 2 to 3 hours of the flight. On pulling out my laptop to do some work I discovered there was not enough room with the seat in front of me to actually open the laptop fully.,0
Amsterdam-Heraklion Economy. Boeing 767-300 plane with maximized number of seats (limited leg space in economy class). For the price paid for a return ticket to Crete the service is basic. Meal is very basic (cheese sandwich small juice apple cookie and small snack) 1 hot and one 1 cold drink (limited choice) and all extra services are paid (alcoholic drinks snacks). In flight entertainment is old movies few boring comedy shows headphones are only for sale. Martinair seems rather a low- cost company without the low-cost tickets part - a return Amsterdam-Crete (3h 30') is at least 300 euro.,0
We have always travelled with SAA between LHR and JHB on our visits to family. Our last trip was different the crew were so much more pleasant this time. In the past one or two looked as if it was a chore to deal with us. This time there was always a smile and cheery banter. Our only complaint was that in both directions we had problems with the IFE no sound or it sounded as if it was under water. Despite re-booting we never did get it right. We've rebooked our next flight already and look forward to it.,1
I flew with Thai round trip SYD-BKK in September. I had no trouble getting emergency exit seats and at no extra cost. The seats were comfortable. The meal provided from Sydney was Lunch and a snack before landing in Bangkok. It wasn't to bad. The Meals provided on Bangkok - Sydney were delicious. The inflight entertainment going was so bad and wouldn't load at all. On the way back there was no inflight entertainment at all. The FA's really didn't appear at all interested in their customer service. After breakfast was served on the return leg the cabin was darkened and the two rows of seats they had reserved by the galley were occupied by the FA's and there they sat talking and giggling for hours. I think Thai needs to perhaps encourage the FA's to provide a little more customer service than they do at the moment. Overall it was a good experience and I would use Thai on long haul again.,1
BSB-SDU Oct 31st. Flight on time no flight entertainment food and beverages only if you pay. Seats uncomfortable as usual. Flight attendant offered me a glass of water just before arrival in Rio de Janeiro.,0
Thomson Sensatori Holiday to Turkey in June Gatwick to Antlaya. Outgoing flight: Checked-in online and printed boarding passes the day before with the idea being when we arrived we went just to 'drop bags'. We arrived nearly 2.5 hrs before the flight to then queue for over an hour - which seemed like a normal 'check-in' and then they printed boarding cards - why ask us to? Flight was cramped probably the smallest plane we've been on impossible to get comfortable and no entertainment for 3.5 hrs. Return flight was even worse - arrived at Antalya airport at 12 noon and got through security for 1.50pm for a 2.15pm flight so no time for food or drink at the airport. The plane was the same as outgoing flight no entertainment this time no food to choose from no ice for drinks etc. Flight experience both ways was awful to say the least.,0
We flew into Australia from the US in the last month and took several flights with Qantas from SYD/BNE BNE/SYD SYD/MEL/HBA HBA/MELB/SYD and we were absolutely impressed with the entire service. Qantas has excellent lounges in BNE MEL and SYD. I had a barista in each lounge except HBA there was also an excellent selection of snacks light meals and premium wines. The flight attendants looked polished while maintaining that down-to-earth friendliness. They were able to accommodate my dietary requirements (vegan) on every flight with either a tasty snack or delicious meal even on those 1 hour flights between HBA/MEL. Admittedly we were sitting in business class so as to be expected the service was excellent.,1
LHR-CMB-BKK return. All flights more or less on time. Food good for economy. Transit in CMB outbound straight forward. Off the plane and into a departure gate within 10 mins. Had to hunt for gate on return but no hassle. The home bound leg is tiring as its all night flights. Seats are a bit hard.,1
"The first time I've flown Spirit. My flight was cancelled 2 days in a row and the second day I was at the airport for 10 hours trying to get on a flight through Spirit, not hearing of the cancellation until 6 hours later after the flight being delayed several times, then standing in line for 3 hours rebooking the flight. I finally got a flight out through United Airlines the next day. The inexpensive prices are not worth the wasted time I spent trying to fly out of Denver. ",0
ATH to FRA. Nice clean A320 polite and smiling crew. Service consisted of nice hot dish (unusual these days for short haul) and dessert Just one round of drinks (wine and beers available free of charge) but those who asked were served a second one with a smile. Crew perhaps a bit too tolerant with passengers who did not respect the seat belt sign during taxiing. .,1
"Columbus to Punta Gorda. Return leg was almost comical - seems they only have one moveable flight of stairs in Punta Gorda. Not good when you have two planes arriving at the same time. We got to the airport and waited while they deplaned and boarded the plane next to our plane. Well almost an hour later they moved the stairs to our plane - what was amazing was the incoming passengers on this flight were still sitting on the plane 60 minutes after they arrived! So we waited and waited we finally boarded and took off 90 minutes after scheduled departure time. Also note that there is no customer service center for this airline. They also have a very annoying practice of asking ""who on this flight got the $10 fares?"" We paid over $400 for our tickets - I certainly could care if the guy next to me paid over $200 less. This airline is just not worth it. The only thing going for it is if you're lucky enough to get one of the cheap tickets - any ticket priced over $30/leg I'd opt for any other carrier.",0
Business Cass with family from Dubai to KL via Colombo. Excellent service and hospitality at value price. Staff most courteous and helpful. Aircraft though a bit old is comfortable. Entertainment system needs updating but is still acceptable. The lounge at Colombo is nice with free Ayurvedic Massage facility.,1
Hong Kong-PVG return cabin crew friendly. Meals great on both and seats comfortable. HKG-PVG was A320 and return was A330 with no ptv's. Dragonair lacks PTV on the A330's.,1
Miami to Amsterdam and I found that the level of comfort was about what one expects these days. The flight attendants came by at regular intervals to offer free drinks and food was generous. One caveat was the in flight entertainment which costs 20 euros.,0
Miami to Aruba for a weekend getaway. Fare was much cheaper than American Airlines. B737-300 was in good shape. The crew was friendly and professional. Contrary to AA Surinam Airways serves a light hot meal each-way with free surinamese beer. Both segments on-time. The only draw-back is that they only operate on Mondays Wednesdays and Fridays. However if you can get past that you're in for a good-quality product.,0
CGN to FAO Cologne to Faro on an A320. Outbound flight a little late due to late arrival of aircraft. Flight was on a jetway but passengers had to use the stairs. Crew were nice and flight was full same on return flight from Faro. I had a smart price ticket so you should sit in row 4 to 14 with more legroom onward flight I was seated row 15 return row 23. As miles and more member in my profile they knew that I needed a lactose free meal but you only get a snack box (cheese sandwich/roll or chicken/salami sandwich/roll) but both are not with butter/margarine they all contain cream cheese as basic spread so I was not able to eat that. When the crew came around I was entitled to only one soft drink you have to pay for wine or a beer. Spirits not available at all. Since both flights were full and only 3 crew members were on board it was a hard job for them. They have less toilets compared to the old LH planes so we had only 2 toilets for almost 150 passengers on the return flight one WC was not serviceable.,0
LHR-MUC-LHR. A321 both ways. LH2479 and LH2470. Outbound was very full. So much so I had to put my weekend hand luggage under the seat in front. Crew where friendly and professional. Inbound less busy. Leg room was sufficient for a short flight and the snack and drink was fresh. On time departure inbound but we were bussed from the jet to the terminal at LHR.,1
This is the worst airline I've been on! This company is very poorly managed. The airline nickles and dimes you for everything. Be careful to read everything before you book because they charge extra to reserve a seat which by the way are uncomfortable and do not even recline. With the exception of 1 employee that I encountered they are not friendly people. None of the flight attendants seemed to like their jobs. None of the employees seem to know their jobs. Our flight departed 3 hours late. Then when the plane couldn't land at our destination because of bad weather they took us to another destination. OK anyone that has flown understands that these things happen. But the attitudes of the workers and the lack of communication made this a horrible experience. We were stranded for almost 7 hours after we were told that ground transportation was being supplied to get us to our destination. What should have been a 3-hour trip turned into an 18-hour ordeal. I will never fly on this airline again.,0
I recently flew to Reunion on Air Austral and was very impressed. I found the service was excellent and far superior to that of Air France.,0
BOS-MUC on A340-600. Smooth check-in with an exceptionally polite and efficient agent. The cabin was spotless with soothing colours and perfect temperature. The FA's were very attentive and maintained the professionalism and efficient service I am accustomed to from LH. The seats were the old angled business class seats which were comfortable in all positions except for sleeping as one tends to slide off the seat. The in-seat USB power did not work on any of the four seats my travel companions and I were seated in. The AVOD selection was limited and inferior to other transatlantic airlines. The meal service was prompt and the food was tasty. There was a wide range of beverage options with a good wine selection. Flight left and arrived on time. Lufthansa offers a good product with dependable service surprises are rare if any.,1
This flight was Amsterdam - Abu Dhabi but I fly regularly from Abu Dhabi around the ME usually 2 or 3 times a month. In the air Etihad are usually OK. Nothing special but OK. On the ground they are one of the worst airlines I experience. This applies to the online booking process online check in at the airport departing and at the airport departing. It is very clear their management have never tried to use their website or travelled with the bulk of their passengers at the back of the plane. On the rare occasions when their website works at all it is usually wrong or fails later. Information at the airports is non existent and passengers are treated as a major inconvenience to the staff. The frequent flyer programme is appalling. Usually wrong often missing flights. When you try to claim lost miles you get an automated message saying they will respond quickly then wait months for anything to happen. Again it is obvious they don't want to provide what you are due. There is never any sign of management in customer facing roles just a group of people who have no power or responsibility. Finally they are always shouting about being the best airline in some poll. Who do they think they are kidding?,0
Duesseldorf - Timisoara return. This airline has been a pleasant surprise. The Saab 2000 was comfortable seats very good and legspace excellent. Food on board was among the best I've seen. The return from Timisoara was operated by an Air Nostrum CRJ-200. Check-in counter at Timisoara opened only 80 minutes before scheduled departure but check-in smooth. Cabin crew was Carpatair staff and they deserve a compliment. On both flights they were friendly helpful and competent.,0
Hong Kong to London Heathrow. The flight left a little late but the new business class on this 777 was truly exceptional and I enjoyed every moment of the 12 hour flight. I even managed to get 6 hours sleep on what I think is a very comfortable bed. The food was very good with a nice selection the lamb shoulder confit was superb as was the pork which was served as dinner before landing. The wines were good again a good choice. The cabin staff were very professional and helpful always there. Overall a great journey and my new favourite airline for business class.,1
Flew from LEX KY to Punta Gorda Florida four times. The last time was April of this year. Arrived on time flight was great crew were nice and for the age of the plane wasn't bad for what I paid. I couldn't afford to go if Allegiant wasn't around. Could not find a better airline for the price anywhere.,1
Flew MXP-HAM on July 4th and back three days later. Onward flight delayed half an hour but no big issue as I was travelling for leisure and Hamburg was my final destination. Plane reasonably clean and comfortable crew friendly even if not as professional as you would expect them to be (often making jokes and laugh among themselves). Seat assignment worked fine so the boarding was smooth even though a bit slow both ways as they start to queue people at the gate well in advance. The best things were price and schedule which is what makes you choose a low cost carrier at the end. I often fly Ryanair as they are based in Bergamo where I live and work and it had been a long time (8 years) since I last flew with Easyjet: this experience was ok and I will still consider them as an option for future trips.,1
"Surly check in staff who turned slow service in to an art form, ripped off to the tune of 50 euros for 0.9kg over weight cabin bag (not offered the opportunity to remove some fruit etc), late boarding with no information from said surly ground staff, cabin crew who seemed to think they were doing us poor hapless passengers a favour by deigning to serve us. I'll spend the extra hundred quid next time and go with a proper airline.",0
OSL-FRA-TXL-FRA-OSL. A couple of hours after I checked-in online the day before I was supposed to travel OSL-FRA- TXL Lufthansa sent me an sms to inform me that my Lufthansa OSL-FRA sector was cancelled due to Lufthansa pilots being up to one of their capricious strikes again. This Lufthansa cancellation caused me a lot of inconvenience. Furthermore it was all in vain trying to call Lufthansa's reservations in Norway and elsewhere in Europe - lines were too busy to get through. So despite my very busy schedule I went to Oslo's Gardermoen airport where SAS do the ticketing for Lufthansa. In a very short time SAS rebooked me on the SAS direct morning flight from Oslo to Berlin-Tegel therefore greatly reducing the inconveniences caused to me by Lufthansa and Lufthansa pilots on strike. I paid extra to fly on Lufthansa as I had to be in Berlin early but in hindsight SAS was cheaper more reliable and better than the competition on this occasion - paying a premium to fly Lufthansa resulted as a waste of money time and effort (given the pilots strike not just SAS but also Norwegian and Ryanair would have been better on this occasion). On the return sectors TXL-FRA-OSL the service was very good and significantly better than I what experienced lately on Lufthansa. However all in all this is was the second time in the space of just 3 months that the industrial disputes between Lufthansa and capricious Lufthansa pilots caused me inconveniences while travelling between Oslo and Berlin. This time the inconveniences were not acceptable to me and as a result similar future travel arrangements will be on other Star Alliance carriers but preferably not Lufthansa.,0
"Good flight on first leg. Used the BA lounge in PHL which is underwhelming. Quick boarding and attendant was pleasant and proactive in our cabin. Served a chilled drink and towel and orders taken for lunch. They emphasise the fact that the meals are a la carte which means you can choose when you want to eat. The food was well presented visually but lacked flavour and I had to send back an over cooked chicken dish. There is a good wine selection. The seats on the 772 are spacious and are laid out in a 2-2-2 fashion. IFE was just okay, nothing special. They supply you with pyjamas, slippers, amenity kits and a thin 'mattress', duvet and pillow. I can't fault the service but the planes need a remodel in terms of the seat and configuration. The downside is the washrooms which in my opinion are no different from J class washrooms. The next sector was on an A332. Terrible seats, limited storage areas and no USB port! Again food was well presented but underwhelming in terms of what you pay for. All planes left on time. I would recommend this airline if the price is good for a C class cabin but interiors need upgrading.",1
I have used Ryanair for years now sometimes 5 times per year in general and all is good. I booked a flight for my daughter and 2 year old granddaughter. When she left Shannon all was well until her return flight home from Tenerife. 6.30 am she checked in for the free allocation of seats they were allocated separate seats opposite side aisles. My daughter went early to the departures queue and boarded one of the first after priority boarding and explained to one of the crew they told her to take her seats and they would try to change her once they were in the air. I find this quite incredible for a flight to take off with a 2 year old baby sat on her own. Surely the crew have the option to change a free allocated seat but what amazes me more was Ryanair had all details as you have to register a child separately when booking. Why if they want more money for a flight just put the price out in the first instance.,0
Had a return flight with them last April from Istanbul-Kayseri and despite being the only experience with Pegasus I can consider it the best LCC that I have had the opportunity to fly. New aircraft very friendly crew (in contrast with overall rude airport staff in Turkey) great prices and adding baggage/meal and allocated seat with a upgrade it is very good value for a small fee in comparison with other LCC. I recommend Pegasus.,1
Horrible experience with Swiss! Flew LUG-GVA and back. Only to find that when I arrived at the Lugano airport the flight had been cancelled probably because of low amount of passengers. Had to make my own arrangements. On the way back the flight was delayed by over 3 hours and cabin crew were very rude. Next time I will fly with Etihad Regional it's cheaper and you get much more value for your money.,0
"Courteous service, good leg room, average food (soggy roll). Four hour delay in Kuala Lumpur with no explanation until on the plane, this is not good enough, it is a common courtesy to communicate. I couldn't even find a place on their website to provide feedback.",0
NRT-DOH-BUD Tokyo to Doha was on a 772LR. The service was excellent with choices ranging from Japanese dishes to westerner quite nice selection of wines as well. Inflight entertainment was good with plenty of movies to chose from. Even though the seat wasn't a fully flat bed I had a good sleep and woke up rested before landing to Doha. The next leg to Budapest was on a 321 not bad but you can't compare it with the business class from the wide- bodied aircraft's. Overall I would recommend flying Qatar Airways I had a good experience.,1
Istanbul-London Heathrow. Bus to the aircraft ??happens so often these days at Istanbul. The chicken meal had run out by the time the cart reached me. Meal I had was good and I relaxed for the rest of the flight. On descent they announced that they would come round for newspapers cups etc but they did not. During the taxi to the gate people started getting up all over the aircraft even though there had been an announcement not to do so but none of the crew attempted to stop them. Luggage was already on the carousel when we arrived. The flight itself was good but efficiency of the crew in my area was appalling.,1
Very unfriendly ground staff at Vilnius airport. I booked my ticket and paid at Tallinn office no mention of hand baggage rules either from the employee or printed on my ticket. I checked in and was told me I could take my hand baggage as carry on. No problem at the gate no problem at transfer gate in Riga to Vilnius. But at Vilnius airport with same hand baggage on my way back to Helsinki via Riga I was harassed by a young lady until I paid 60 Euros to check in my hand baggage because it was 12 kg instead of 8.9 kg. For a 276 Euros ticket Tallinn- Vilnius-Helsinki it's really unpleasant the flight was not full the overhead lockers were empty above my seat. As I did not speak Lithuanian I had less chance than other passengers that were allowed to bring their 13 kg baggage as carry on.,0
"Lion Air (operated by Wings Air) Flight from Bali to Lombok was cancelled and then delayed for 6 hours. Check in and boarding processes were chaotic. Information updates were either non existent met with shrugs or told anything to keep us ""satisfied"". Similar experience on return flight but only 3.5 hours late. Avoid these two airlines at all costs.",0
Round trip to canary islands on this Swiss airline. Clean aircraft friendly and efficient FAs good info from the flight deck - deserves a 4 star ranking!,1
Flight ZB751 from Dalaman 7th October. Not much fun being on board with a drunk who had consumed a whole bottle of his own duty free vodka. Stewardess did enquire if he was drinking his own alcohol of course he lied! Was disappointed that they did not contact security ahead of landing and have an official to greet him. I felt very anxious in a confined space Monarch staff were aware of the situation but chose to ignore. As we wanted to distance ourselves from this man this resulted in my leaving my handbag on board I realised once through Passport control. Nobody wanted to help. Trying to actually speak to someone at Monarch is appalling.,0
Toulouse to Edinburgh Sunday 24 August 2014. Myself and fellow traveller with chosen seats in row 1 pleasant enough flight but on arrival at Edinburgh the ground staff member advised the chief steward that he had not closed the door properly on departure. Not at all reassuring and even if this being the case might have mentioned this more discretely and certainly not in front of passengers. Bad enough that the average age of the fleet is 25 years old to treat the safety of all on board with such disregard is just inexcusable.,1
Paris-Muscat-Bangkok return in Business Class (December 21st 2012 and January 1st 2013). Wonderful experience. The seat is more comfortable than all the other business class seats I know and even some first class seats (only negative point: a lack of storage room in the middle seats). Very good food with a Top Chef cuisine and a very good service. Nice lounges in BKK and MCT with very good food. Definitely my favourite airline.,1
SUF-TRN on new Embraer E-175. Fast check-in good flight good food great service from flight crew plane very clean. No problems.,1
"Gatwick - Las Vegas - Gatwick. B747-400. Never again. I'd rather stay in the rainy UK than give Virgin any of my money. Paid Â£4.400 for premium economy seats to Las Vegas for 3 people. I've never seen any crew be so rude to passengers. 1 beer after take off from Gatwick asked for another with lunch rather than wine was told ""wine water or nothing"". Food is nice and nice to have a choice but in a premium cabin on any airline that's what I expect and the liquors after lunch or dinner is a nice touch. Only other offer of drinks is juice or water throughout the 11 hour flight. Can not comment on any other cabin service as we never saw the crew for the rest of the flight it seems Virgin crew go to work so sleep in the crew rest area they told the passengers about rather than serve passengers that pay to be on the aircraft. When the seat in front of you is reclined you can't get out of your seat. Had no choice but to fly virgin as BA didn't fly to Vegas on he date we had to travel. Never again will I fly on a Virgin aircraft if I have a choice. So rude.",0
Traveled from Vienna to Bangkok. New seats but uncomfortable. Good size TV screen. Food portion was too small and instead of breakfast just one dry sandwich was just a joke. Will never fly again with such a terrible airline. Another jaw dropping fact was when lady next to me asked me to get her drink because she was feeling ill. I went to the back of the plane to report it and was only given drink for her and smile and they didn't bother to go and check on her.,0
"Flight EY6298 - flight operated by South African Airways SA278 on 24 June 2015. Excellent service by South African Airways! Good tasty food, good wines, friendly staff (Etihad can learn from them). Flight EY57 - 25 June 2015 operated by Etihad. Good service, friendly staff (still South African Airways offers slightly better service and has more leg space). Several hours delay in Abu Dhabi as this airport can clearly not handle high volume of air traffic and passengers. The airport cannot handle the flux of passengers. There is by far not enough seating at the airport, the airport is simply outdated. Flight EY58 - 18 July 2015. A horrible experience. The aircraft seemed to be a loan from Alitalia. One staff member in economy class was simply rude. The seat was sticky with dried food remains, so did the later discovery that the pocket in the seat in front of me was sticky as well. It came clear why when unfolding the table which had food left over and dried sticky juice all over. A crew member helped cleaning the table, yet leaving me with sticky pants and sticky floor carpet under the seat in front of me. Flight EY 6299 - operated by South African Airways, flight SA 279. Service on board, excellent once again by South African Airways. Very friendly and considered staff! On arrival in Johannesburg, about 150 passengers found out that the luggage never arrived in Johannesburg. The queue for baggage claim was very long, yet well handled by South African Airways staff. The entire debacle cost us 2.5 hours! We were told an aircraft would arrive at 16h00 local time with some luggage. At 18h00 hours nothing heard of course. If luggage would not be there with this mentioned flight, it would be the following day. No need to say I have lost all confidence with Etihad.",0
LAX to LHR AA 136 27th Jan. New AA Business Class. Lounge very relaxing and bar served a variety of drinks. Nibbles were ok and more substantial food was available for a fee. Once on board this is the new lie flat AA product and feels more like a first class seat than business. Flight staff were very attentive and the service on the 9 hour overnight flight was great. Amazing food great entertainment on a large screen and the seat is great for working and sleeping too. A decent pillow and fleece blanket are provided. THe walk up bar with snacks during the flight was great as were the massive toilets in which you can change into more comfy wear for sleeping pj's are not provided. Bose headphones made for cinema sound and the amenity kit was of a good quality too. Food servings being on an American carrier are generous. All in all an excellent product and this does give Emirates and Etihad a run for their money as one of the best in the sky - well worth a try.,1
JFK-SVO-CDG and SVO-JFK. A330 New York-Moscow excellent new and seats were good (2x4x2). Travelling with my wife it was convenient to have the seats to ourselves without someone else next to us. A320 Paris-Moscow just okay nothing extraordinary but not bad (3x3 seating LCD screens in the row). Personal IFE with good selection of movies in Russian and English on JFK-SVO. They served a hot meal with alcoholic beverages plus usual assortment of soft drinks even on flight Moscow to Paris. As someone who'd flown Aeroflot over the past 20 years they have changed for the better over the last couple of years - and are by far the cheapest option to fly from NY to Moscow.,1
Hong Kong - Guangzhou. Check in for the early morning flight was very busy at the airport. As I have a connecting flight that night on Air France I asked the ground staff whether bags could be checked through to the next flight as one can the other way round. She made a lot of different calls but the answer was still no. The flight departed from the remote terminal (which seems to be a Dragonair exclusive terminal) which is a bus ride away. Take at least a good 15 minutes to get to the gate. Nothing could go wrong on a 30 minutes ride in the air. Upon arrival checked with the Dragonair ground staff in Guangzhou and he was apologetic about my bag not being checked through and asked if I could lock my bag and he would keep it for me which I could claim it back that night from their office in the hotel opposite to the terminal. Wonderful service and their office does remain open as promised that evening.,1
Portland-Denver-Jackson Hole in A320/A319. Smooth online booking online check-in and bag drop Flights on time and the service efficient. Seats in the cheapest part of the plane offered as much legroom as premium airlines' Economy. A non-alcoholic drink was served on each leg (no free snack). The hub at Denver was quite crowded and busy. Luggage took a long time to be unloaded at Jackson Hole. Overall a good experience.,1
Wont ever fly them again! Cheap is cheap you get nothing comfortable or convenient. All I can say good is we got from point A to point B. They charged us 50$ for a bag that was 46 pounds (most airlines that's within the 50# allotted). They are rude. No snacks nor pop are free even after delayed twice. Seats have no room and plane is cramped badly. Very uncomfortable flight. We sat waiting to even pull away from where we board for 40 minutes before getting out to taxi down runway. I would pay the little extra and fly a better airline any day!,0
I've flown long haul with Virgin and their Premium Economy product is excellent but Air New Zealand's just takes it that one notch above (although it does cost slightly more too). Firstly the seat - it's in a shell so the seat tilts and slides rather than reclines into the space behind you. You're also angled slightly and so if you're in the outer seats you're not obliged to talk to the person next to you - it's your own personal space. I paid the extra for seats at the front of the cabin and they're well worth the upgrade - so much legroom and easy to get in and out (useful if travelling solo). The centre seats are better for couples as you can share the space. Check their website for information. The food was excellent served on crockery with metal cutlery. You'll get your starter etc first and wait some time for the hot meal meanwhile your dessert is also sat in front of you being very tempting! The hot food was good although the menu options were a little unusual - both times I went for the fish as the other options (beef and chicken) contained various things I didn't care for. The service was impeccable - the staff were very friendly except one attendant who seemed a little off although still professional. Inflight entertainment is on a decent sized touch screen although there is also a remote in the side of the seat. The selection was surprising - there were a large number of retro movies rather than all the latest blockbusters (of which there were few). However this was actually quite nice as I watched a few older favourites rather than having to gamble on new choices. My favourite thing about the IFE was being able to order drinks and snacks from the screen. Just tap an option or two and it's delivered to your seat a few minutes later whilst you continue to watch your movie. All seats have USB sockets for charging and I think you can link them up to a USB drive but I didn't test this. Also charging sockets are available for your laptop. You can use a standard UK plug as well as US and some other options. The toilets! Firstly two toilets dedicated to Premium Economy - so no queuing. And they were the best - fancy wallpaper with funny fake bookshelves on it (read some of the titles) and music piped in too. Frankly I would pay the upgrade just for those! Finally when flying to the USA you are right near the front of the plane so you're off quickly and can hot foot it to immigration to hopefully beat the queues. Unless you have ridiculously high standards of what you expect from a metal tube flying through the air I don't think you'll be disappointed.,1
Flew KUL-BWN and return. Both flights left early due to Ramadan. The outbound flight was 100% full in economy and empty in Business. The crew were friendly and a hot meal was distributed to everyone who wanted one and for those who were fasting a meal box was given to be eaten after sunset. On the return the plane only had 29 passengers on board yet the crew continued their high standards and the flight was very enjoyable.,1
Sydney to Amsterdam return. Ticket was fantastic value for money. (A330-200 were almost new and in excellent condition. Cabin crew fantastic. Food was good and drinks offered frequently. Only criticism is 15 hours wait in Jakarta for connecting flight to Sydney. We were able to use Emerald lounge at the airport (free of charge on SYD-AMS flight) with plenty of food and drinks but the wait is agonisingly long.,1
"Business class on JNB-CAI in June 2013. At check-in onward boarding cards were not provided. Comment ""you have to get them in Cairo"". At boarding gate seat changed due to ""system error"" - in fact this was not correct but my good seat was provided to someone else. Onboard asked for another seat that was provided by cabin staff. Minutes later the Purser chased me away saying that seat was for the crew. Taken to seat directly in front of toilet. Blanket and pillow used amenity kit missing. No storage space for hand luggage as middle row does not have luggage compartments. Missing amenity kit was provided later. Upon arrival hand luggage of my colleague had ""disappeared"". Cabin crew unwilling to support but finally pushed the task to ground staff. Had to get our onward boarding cards at transit desk. Long queue (approx 30min.) for Economy but moderate waiting time at business desk. Afterwards long queue at security check for international connection flights. Actually only one X-ray machine with around 20mins waiting time. Finally only luggage was run through machine I carried my pullover jacket and mobile phone through detector but nobody reacted.",0
Traveled OOL-KUL-SIN then HGH-KUL and then KUL-OOL. With one exception the flights were on time or early the crew were helpful friendly and efficient. Our pre-booked meals were of a high standard the food available for purchase on board also appeared to be very reasonably priced coffee was 5MYR per cup (around AU/US$1.70 per cup). In all cases the aircraft were young clean and in very good condition. On our initial two stage flight our baggage was checked to the final destination and we were able to simply use the transit facilities at LCCT instead of having to go through Immigration baggage collection Customs and rechecking etc. The seats were comfortable but a little narrower however unless you're overweight this shouldn't be a problem legroom appeared to be comparable with other airlines. We've flown with a range of full service airlines and previously with AAX in our opinion AAX rates very favourably and if you can buy their sale fares they represent outstanding value. We wouldn't hesitate to fly with them again!,1
F9 916 5/31/15 and F9 1287 6/1/15. The seats were uncomfortable my seat woul not recline and it was hard as a rock. The hidden charges made the flight overly expensive added 90 dollars to my trip each way for seat choice and small bag carry-on. The service was terrible and no one around to answer questions at the Chicago airport. I ordered a Chardonnay off the menu and it came in a can with a gorilla face on it marked white wine and it had bubbles in it I took one sip and could not drink the rest it was horrible a waste of $7. None of the attendants or counter people were friendly or helpful. I usually fly Southwest and hope I never have to fly frontier again.,0
CDG-FLR on an A318. The flight was firstly late due to a technical issue with the plane. We waited on the tarmac with most of the doors open in the 3' C weather for about 45 mins. The food was atrocious. First of all is it too much of a luxury for AF to provide actual milk instead of powdered milk with their tea and coffee? The meal was a little sugary cheese something bun which was barely edible. The configuration of the plane was a little odd with small narrow and pretty uncomfortable seating with a very wide aisle. The staff were friendly enough but the IFE was non-existent. For a full service airline I thought that this flight was pretty poor. I would probably fly AF if I got a good price but for most routes you can probably get a comparable level of service on a low cost airline for much less.,0
MUC-SKG on 17th of Dec. One-way. New A320 with new style of seats quite uncomfortable though. Friendly and nice crew. A hot meal was served in this short flight and drinks. However passengers didn't obey at all to the new cabin baggage rules causing space problems and minor delays and the crew did nothing about it. Rules should be more strictly enforced.,1
Flew from Durban to London Gatwick via Dubai. The first leg of the flight was awful - seat backrest was broken staff could not fix it so they moved us to two different seats which were even worse with a solid lump at the base of the backrests that made it impossible to get comfortable in any position on this long flight. The second leg was great in a two-week old aircraft where we could finally sit in comfort. Unfortunately the Durban-Dubai experience has put me off Emirates.,0
I flew several Times with Zest MNL either to TAG an CEB. My flights were never on time and very poor customer service at all stations. Comparing it to the same price level airlines which are offered with in the Philippines I would recommend not to fly with Zest Air.,0
SEA-ICN (July 17th) + ICN-SGN (July 18th) This was my third time flying Asiana. The flight crew was very polite entertainment system had a great selection of movies takeoff and landing was good and the flight was smooth overall! I really appreciated the drinks that the flight crew brought us every 20 minutes or so starting at the middle of the flight! ICN-SGN was somewhat less desirable. We scrambled from security and nearly missed the connecting flight but the airport crew was very kind and let me and about 30 others through. The Boeing 777 was very cramped and I was stuck in the middle seat the entertainment system was aged and it was really hard to sleep so the flight seemed much longer than SEA-ICN.,1
LGW-KEF 8-13 Oct. Quick check-in had pre-booked seats. Slow boarding due to large numbers of cabin baggage needing to be stored but flight departure on time. A320 cramped seating but typical of a low cost airline friendly and helpful staff and early arrival into KEF. Baggage off quickly. On return check-in slower pre-booked seats were not honoured staff very strict over hand baggage. Messy boarding and slightly late departure. Again onboard staff extremely friendly and helpful however little to no announcement from flight deck throughout. On time arrival into LGW and baggage off quickly. For the price was impressed however online check-in is needed.,1
Economy class on 28 Aug from London (LHR) to New York (JFK). Boarding was in Terminal 5 which I love as I can sit Gatwick - Orlando - Gatwick. Club world both ways. B777-200. Worth the money every penny of it. Crew on the outbound sector were fairly young and were a little rude seemed like everything was a chore. If you asked for something they hadn't got on the cart you couldn't have it. Polite enough but not really interested in the passengers. Crew inbound not being disrespectful but they were older and much nicer. Nothing was too much bother. If they hadn't got it there and then they got it right away for you. Lie-flat beds comfortable enough and baggage allowance of 3 bags per passenger is great for the shopping. Food and drinks are good however I do think the food on Thomson Airways in premium is better than BA club world. In form of scheduled carriers British Airways are ten times better than Virgin in so many ways and would fly with BA again no questions asked.,1
SG3302 from Belgaum (IXG) to Chennai (MAA) via Bengaluru (BLR) by VT-SUP (Q400 propeller aircraft). Departed ahead of time from Belgaum and arrived around 30 mins early into Bengaluru. The plane stopped at BLR for around an hour for refuelling and cleaning. BLR to MAA flight also departed around 20 mins early from BLR. Clouds at Chennai made the landing very turbulent. However the (only 2) cabin crew were very friendly and smiling.,1
Boeing 757-200 Gatwick to Antalya return. My husband and I returned from Antalya a 4 hour flight at 4am Wednesday (after a 3 hour delay). We had the same problem on our outward journey. The worst thing was the inadequate seating space plus both of our seats had clasped so it was just impossible from the time we sat down to get any comfort. I had a bump on my seat which caused discomfort at the base of my spine. Difficult to eat our meals because of elbow room. We sat in row 40E and F at the back of the aircraft the seats did not tilt back to any degree so we sat bolt upright for the 4 hour night flight! Yes we tried to buy extra leg room on the way back but there was none available. What a shame Thomas Cook! Everything else was just great!,0
Economy from BNE-NAN then Biz NAN-LAX. Fly with Fiji alot and are very rarely disappointed. Both flights were good and the tidy up with the lounge in NAN has improved it as well. Flew home Biz with Qantas and their food was nowhere near as good as Fiji's. We have never had a problem with any of the cabin staff. Will be using them again in February and look forward to it.,1
"I've been commuting between RDU to EWR for the past few months. As a loyal Delta flyer I transitioned over to United because they offer direct flights into Newark. What I've learned - you pay double the price for United as opposed to other airlines for delays and cancellations due to ""flight crew availability"". I had the opportunity to speak to a flight attendant about my weekly (yes every week) cancelation or delay and was informed that United was contracting crew out due to limited number of employees. Most employees have left because United pays them dirt. Shame on United and shame on the airline industry - those of us that fly on a regular basis (3 weeks out of the month) pay premium prices for a terrible experience. When I call or contact United - they could care less. Hence my loyalty to Delta - they listen acknowledge apologize and reword you for any and all challenges. As far as recommending United - use at your own risk and be prepared to have a Plan B C and D for when your cancelled due to lack of availability of flight crew.",0
Flew from Manchester to Dhaka (14th January) return Dhaka to London (11th January). Completely mixed bag experience when comparing the outbound and return journeys. The outbound was 10 out 10 due to punctuality professionalism amenities etc. I took advantage of the free Istanbul Tour offered by the Turkish Airlines. For the return leg the flight was delayed by 7.5 hours due to foggy conditions at Dhaka which obviously is not Turkish's fault. I was put on a different connecting flight to London which was supposed to depart within 1 hour of the arrival of the Dhaka flight to Istanbul. However the flight took 8.5 hours instead of 7 hours which meant that I missed the London flight. But what made this experience worse is the lack of in-flight entertainment system on this 8.5 hour flight. If Turkish is to compete with the other Airlines (Emirates Qatar Etihad) flying to Dhaka it has to take the Istanbul-Dhaka-Istanbul route seriously and ensure consistency across the flights.,1
Disgraceful. Flight cancelled via text 10pm night before 6am flight. Staff very unhelpful after waiting on hold for close to an hour. Lost $250 car hire and $450 accommodation fees. Never use Tiger again. Flight shows as sold out on web and still scheduled to fly out at 6 in the morning?,0
First time with Jetstar to Bangkok on 17th December. The flight from Singapore to Bangkok was fine. 15 minutes into the return flight to Singapore we had to return to Bangkok as ice had formed on the wings. We waited for more than 2 hours at the airport without knowing what would happen next. There was no communication between the ground staff and the passengers. We did even get a drink from the ground staff. Only when we approached the staff then we realized we had to stay in Bangkok for another night. Without giving proper instructions we were lead like blind mice around the airport. We waited again for more than half an hour before we were transported to a hotel near the airport. The ground staff were not be able to handle the situation well which left us feeling lost and frustrated. This will be my first and last flight with Jetstar.,0
"Flight was canceled, had to take the next available flight which was the next day. Next day flight delayed twice and gate changed twice. It ended up being a whole day of travel. No vouchers were given. After emailing and complaining the gave us three $50 vouchers. ",0
Singapore-Chiang Mai-Singapore as part of a Singapore Airlines codeshare ticket. Flight to Chiang Mai was a little late departing but flight back to Singapore departed on time. Both aircraft very clean and well presented. Cabin crew were very friendly and responsive to any request. Legroom quite acceptable for a regional airline. Food was also very nice and actually more than we had expected. If these two flights were typical of Silkair we would be very happy to fly them again anytime.,1
"Flew FNJ-PEK last week. Handling on ground smooth and efficient accepting a couple of kgs more weight than allowed without even a question aircraft clean and modern service friendly and with a smile both on the ground and in the air. Ok catering and a good choice of drinks given the short leg of just 1.5 hrs flight time. On time flight. I guess the bad rating comes from the ""old"" Air Koryo operating but since a while both their equipment and their attitude has changed strongly and it's another carrier now.",1
After reading all of the reviews warning us of delays and cancelled flights we opted to fly Jetstar Pacific from HCM to DaNang fully aware of the ramifications for our actions. The price was too good to resist and we couldn't see the point of paying triple that with Vietnam Airlines. Check in was a slight issue with flights being cancelled left right and centre. The poor staff did their best to deal with an array of angry and difficult customers - but what do you expect for the money you paid? Our flight was delayed 10 hours but staff were lovely and moved us to an earlier flight so we only had to wait 5 hours. In saying this we noticed all of the Vietnam Airlines flights were delayed as well due to weather or late aircraft's. I was happy we hadn't paid an excessive amount to still be sitting around at the airport. If you want to fly out of HCM I would recommend Jetstar for their excellent prices. However next time I would opt to get the bus and avoid delays altogether!,1
Flew SYD-AUH-GRU-AUH-SYD. My SYD-AUH flight was operated by Virgin Australia and was an excellent experience that I will not comment on here. The other three flights were operated by Etihad which were fine enough. AUH-GRU and return was on an A340 - the planes felt a little old but there was plenty of space compared to most economy seats I've been in. However AUH-SYD was on a B777 with quite possibly the worst economy long-haul seat I've experienced. The plane was nice and new and the IFE was excellent but the 3-4-3 layout meant the seat width was very narrow and uncomfortable even for a skinny guy like myself. It was hard to walk up and down the aisles to get to the bathrooms due to lack of space - kept bumping into people and I'm glad I wasn't sitting in an aisle seat otherwise I would have been extremely annoyed by this. Virgin Australia use a 3-3-3 layout on the exact same plane and it was very comfortable. Etihad need to learn something from their partner.,1
Very good direct flights Gatwick to Hanoi and then Ho Chi Min back to Gatwick both direct. Seats were comfortable despite 10 hours one way and 12 coming back. Service very good.,1
We were telephoned by First Choice to upgrade to premium for our flight Gatwick to Jamaica 20th May. We were told we would get extra leg room fast track for security and check in up graded meals and free drinks. This was the first time we have upgraded on a flight and my husband bought it for us for my birthday present at some Â£500+. The check in and fast track at London Gatwick was good and fast. The seats had good leg room and were quite comfortable. The staff were good. We had already seen most of the films - poor small selection. The drinks were free but then so were the drinks for economy. The food was not good. The passengers from economy used premier toilets so I had to queue. For the flight home to Gatwick there was no fast track system for premier even though we had been told by First Choice that it was included so we had to spend more money and buy VIP lounge tickets for MOBAY at Grantly Adams airport (the lounge and system was excellent). The flight home meals were not good and upon arrival at Gatwick economy passengers were allowed to disembark before Premium. We feel that the Â£500 was a waste of money overall and that we were misled by the sales team at First Choice wjo sold us the upgrade. The flight felt safe with good time take off and landing. We would not buy premier class again and feel ripped off by First Choice/Thomson.,0
"Their short flight services are just a total circus. Had two different return flights with them last month both in Europe. One from Helsinki to Budapest and one from Helsinki to Gdansk. Luggage restrictions food and beverage PRICES and in general regular prices for tickets made me feel like fool for paying ""full service"" and flying low cost. Big disappointment.",0
Recently travelled JNB-MUR-JNB in economy class. I found the seats and legroom to be the most uncomfortable I have experienced on a long haul flight. Cabin crew pretty cheerful and food edible. In flight entertainment limited but given that it is a 4 hour flight not the end of the world. Would probably use another carrier on my next trip to Mauritius.,0
Just returned with my son from a short break in Iceland. Its a wonderful place with nice people but badly served by its airline. Flights there and back delayed due to lack of available aircraft/late arrival of incoming flight and waiting for the return leg from Iceland there were constant airport announcements of badly delayed Icelandair flights to destinations all over Europe for the same reason. Surely a logistics problem that could be resolved. Terrible staff on flight out lovely staff on return so some people in the company do know about customer care but culturally and corporately this is not embedded.,0
Flew BCN-LGW on April 16th departure was on time and arrival slightly early. The aircraft was a 16 year old A321. The cabin seemed a bit old but very tidy nevertheless. Cabin crew did the best they could to help us they seemed very professional. My only complaint is the seat. It was really old and rather uncomfortable although for such a short flight I don't consider this a major inconvenience. They were the cheapest from BCN to London on those dates and I would certainly fly with them again in the future.,1
BRU-WAW-LCA 5 January 2014. Web-check-in system very easy but as usual many front seats blocked in advance even if I always try to check in online as soon as web-check-in opens. This is a night flight from Brussels to Warsaw and then in Larnaca it arrives at 02.55am (+1). Flight from Brussels left with 20 mins delay but this was not a problem as there was enough layover time in Warsaw for my connection flight to Larnaca. Arriving in Warsaw and going to the gate there was already announced 15 mins delay in boarding. It seems that most of the people don't respect the hand baggage allowance rule and also the airline itself shows much tolerance on this. I could see many people (all in economy) boarding carrying 2-3 handbags and ground staff and flying attendants saying nothing about it. This gets annoying because besides onboard safety it is the space issue in the overhead cupboards not enough space for everybody. After boarding and being seated we had to wait in the aircraft for 50 mins. Pilot informed us after 30 mins we had to wait for baggage and that is why there was a delay. In any case flight left with almost an hour delay and arrived in Larnaca at 3.25 am instead of 2.55am. Service was average (as usual LOT doesn't offer onboard meals and you have to buy your food). Food is reasonably priced. Flight attendants polite but many not very friendly. I recommend this flight mainly because of the good connections and time schedule allowing you to not waste your day flying but instead flying in the evening.,1
"This review is written due to what I feel is true reflection of the decline of a once great airline. Check in took 30 minutes as the agent was dealing with a couple and escorted them to the lounge and made us wait until he returned. The first class security lane was manned by the rudest staff I have ever come across. The lounge was fine, but it is looking tired. Service good and range of menu was broad and wines good. No priority boarding, had to queue in the airbridge for 10 minutes, no greeting at the door, no escort to seat, no jacket hung up and the seat was dirty (covered in crumbs and other such food). Opened two magazines both torn, ripped and in rag order. Staff very pleasant, professional, and very helpful. Food ok not First class, wines good. The entertainment system was broken and kept rebooting itself. The seat would not lie flat and hard to move. Bought on board duty free and asked would I need a sealed bag to bring it through to my connection told yes. Deplaned, no escort, no gate to go to, given wrong directions to the lounge. Had to clear immigration although not entering the UK, waited 45 minutes to be told duty free I bought on board could not go through I would need to go to check in although told the opposite on board. This was done, had to reclear security again, got to the lounge asked for a shower, told too busy. Connection flight was delayed by one hour, waited at the gate. Flight to Dublin short, salad served and tea. Priority bags were the last bags on the belt. Overall this is not first class, it is not even premium economy. I fly 12-14 times a year and gold level. BA you have lost your edge, I will stay loyal to Qatar, Emirates and Cathay Pacfic whose consistent hard wear and soft product is worth the money and deserves my business. My advice do not waste your money with BA, it's service cutting to the point of insult.",0
MAD-ALG and ALG-MAD. Impressed with the punctuality with the departure and arrival time. The quality of the service was very good in terms of staff on board and on the ground. FA's were attentive. I flew them again from SFO-ORD-MAD with the second leg with Iberia and again I was not disappointed. My only complaint is Madrid Barajas Airport. At the airport there are no real amenities for the long haulers. Will fly Iberia again.,1
I travelled with Cebu Pacific on 1 Feb 2015 from MNL-USU and on 3 Feb 2015 from USU-MNL in the afternoon and from MNL-SIN in the evening. I was worried after reading all the negative reviews about CP as it was my first time travelling with them and deliberately gave myself a long layover (about 5hrs) btw my return flight from USU and then to SIN on the same day. I pleasantly surprised when I travelled with them. I did a web check-in and got to the check-in counter 2hrs before flight time. Ground crew was friendly and polite. Flight left on time for MNL-USU and there was only a 15 min delay from MNL-SIN. Seats are typically what you find on a budget air. Didn't eat so can't comment on the food. Good thing CP is at Terminal 3 as I could eat do a massage and shop a bit during my layover. Would fly with them again.,1
"We flew to Barbados on 18th December 2014 in premium economy and were highly delighted. The leg room was 34"" and the food on board is the best I have ever eaten on a plane (and I have flown many times). We had to pay for extra movies (Â£6.00) and we had to pay for drinks but when I priced our flight with Virgin (which we always fly with) the price was Â£3500 the price with Thomas Cook on premium economy was Â£1800 now Â£1700 difference to me was a lot and I was highly delighted with the service we received. If I had to fault one thing them it would be the stop over in St Lucia it was a little unorganised but once we had people settled in the flight to Barbados was 26 minutes so I can live with that. Would I fly with Thomas Cook again - yes I would after saving Â£1700.",1
East Midlands to Palma Majorca. The whole process from checking in online baggage drop on time departures Jet2 staff were very friendly. First time I have flown with Jet2 and I would highly recommend a fantastic experience!,1
"This is my third time using Westjet and it will be the last, all three times have been a horrible experience, but this last time has been an absolute disaster. Our flight to New York was scheduled for 4:15 pm - while waiting it was announced that the flight will be 10-15 minutes late, on the plane the pilot announced that we will be another 15 minutes late and 20 minutes later he announces that we will be departing at 6:15. We were given permission to leave the plane but to be back by 5:30. At 5:30 we were told that the flight has been cancelled and to go to the desk at the gate to be put on another flight. At the gate we are told 30 minutes later that there are no flights to New York for the rest of the day. Back through customs after an hour of waiting in a line that was hardly moving we are told to get out of the line and call Westjet to re-book the flight for the next day. Called Westjet and told that there is a flight at 8:25 to New York, after the manager says all flights are cancelled. The customer service rep on the phone says to me I can book you on the 8:25 flight but there is no guarantee that it wont be cancelled. We were expected to wait another 2 hours and to find out whether there is a flight or not which is the best they could offer. I asked for a refund so I can book with another airline and which is refused saying that it was not their fault it was La Guardia Airport that cancelled the flights. I rebooked my flight for the next morning at 7:00, which meant another $100.00 for cab fair ($50.00 each way) and waking up at 4:00 am to get to the airport by 6:00. A flight that takes one hour started with me leaving my home at 2:30 pm and reaching New York at 9:20 the next morning.",0
Flew TPE-CGK on Garuda was supposed to fly on July 13th instead was moved to July 14th due to typhoon. The food was good the inflight entertainment was good though there's still room from improvement. The food was good had some grilled fish for breakfast. Seat was better than SQ's. I'm stunned with the improvement and will definitely fly with Garuda again but on Executive Class maybe.,1
I have flown twice with Finnair to Beijing and to Delhi both times from LHR via Helsinki. The long haul legs have been good with seat back entertainment and modern comfortable planes with pretty good leg room. The food is fair. Helsinki airport is small modern and well organised so plane switches are quite easy sometimes adjacent gates. The price of both flights was good.,1
DE 6229 Cape Town to Frankfurt 1 December 2013 Seats: 31 D and E. We had high expectations from this airline because of it being a direct flight and the time it would save us. The first problem was with the on-line check in. We with our travel agent tried many times during the 24 hours before the flight with no success. We checked in 3 hours before the flight and could only secure 2 seats in the middle block. We were squashed with less leg room than in all of the many planes we flew in the past for nearly 12 years. It was extremely uncomfortable. This flight was the very first long distance international flight where we had to pay for alcoholic drinks. When the main meal was served (curry chicken) which my wife may not eat she asked for a possible alternative. The stewardess was very rude and replied that in the economy class you must accept what is served you don't get any choices. Why should economy class passengers which is the bulk of your business seen as inferior to the others. Your entertainment system is outdated and very basic and leaves you no personal choice of films and added to this that you even have the audacity to charge for the headset. We received none of the much appreciated extras as routinely supplied by your competitors that may improve your flight like earplugs toothbrush etc. Except for the return flight which leaves us no alternative you can be sure that we will never fly with them again.,0
Brisbane-Sydney-Brisbane in the last week. Great service all round including opportunity to check luggage 3 hours before flights. Delay with return flight fully explained by the cockpit.( no fault of Virgin). Cabin crew friendly and professional both ways and ground staff excellent.,1
The flight from Vancouver to Guangzhou was terrible tight cramped seats in a less than clean plane. Washrooms were smelly and poorly maintained. Service was minimal had to go to the back of the plane where staff were socializing to request a beverage. The return flight was on their new Dreamliner which was clean however seating was small and very cramped. We had booked these flights months in advance but there was no option to book seats and were forced to sit apart!,0
"2 flights - HER to ATH (short 50 minutes) and ATH to MXP. Both went well and flights were on time. Unexpected snacks and drinks on flight. Breakfast on MXP flight. Fast check-in, friendly cabin staff and quick baggage claim.",1
It was my first time using this airline and I will never use them again. I bought the ticket from Rome to Nice on February 2014 for the flight on 11 September 2014. In March I received notice from them that their daily flight from Rome to Nice would change from 11.55 AM to 7.15pm. I had to change my own schedule because I know what kind of headache I would get trying to get a refund from them. On the day of the flight I found out that there's no use of printing your own boarding pass beforehand because there's still a long line at the check in desks. There's no separate lines for bag-drop. After dropping my baggage I was told that the flight will be delayed for 40-minutes. Then during boarding the crew told me that I couldn't bring my hand bag because I already had a back pack with me. I had to drop one or pay 55EUR. I offered 70EUR cash but was told they only accepted credit card. I will never use this airline again.,0
SYD-ICN-CDG return. SYD-ICN by A330 and met expected cabin standards but after breakfast cabin crew asked that shades be drawn - at 11am on an originating flight. Remaining sectors by B777-200 and were simply substandard with a 7-section seat that is far from flat let alone fully flat. The crew fitted vertical plates to the footrest after takeoff to stop you slipping down and under the seat in front. Inflight entertainment was primitive. On two sectors the purser apologised for mistakes by cabin staff who were friendly but amateurish.,0
Flew on the 15th of June from Glasgow Intl. as the start of a 2 week holiday to Tenerife South. The check in desk people were extremely helpful as we had requested a window seat for my son. We were given it and shortly went through to departures. Plane took off 5 minutes late but didn't bother anyone as the plane arrived ahead of schedule. The seats had lots of legroom as it was the new 757/300 the inflight entertainment was good. Food was lovely. Coming back the plane was the same one we took off and arrived 25 minutes before scheduled time. It was a night time flight and was a good one very peaceful and there were not a lot of announcements due to the time which I thought was good.,1
Aircraft was clean and up to date. Lufthansa service was good as usual. There was a new entertainment system available that was more user friendly than the old one and provided more choice. The problem with the entertainment system were the headphones: the volume could not be adjusted so that all dialogues in movies were understandable.,1
Flew fully flex economy fare that was very poor value for money. Aircraft SYD-BNE very tired old Virgin Blue coloured 737 toilets filthy bins overflowing. Flight left 25 min late despite boarding on time! 2 passengers arrived 10 min after departure. A lot of flight crew for other VA flights onboard. Flight late to leave and late to destination. Stairs used to unload instead of aerobridge. Entertainment non-existent unless to wi-fi. Snack that came with fare made QF's legendary stinginess look actually good. Drinks limited despite what was in the menu not cold. Cabin crew more interested in appearance and seemed bothered by passengers actually asking for things often ignored call attendant buttons. My second leg just as forgettable if not worse. IMO VA still very much a no frills airline albeit more pricy than before that has flashy advertising. I wil l be certainly avoiding them in the future for cheaper options where I get what I pay for!,0
My flight from Toronto to Costa Rica was delayed departing due to a long queue to be de-iced after a pretty major snow storm. I along with 39 others found myself stranded in El Salvador having missed my connecting flight. The TACA ground staff were great - after getting us all rebooked onto a morning flight we were bussed to a great hotel fed 2 meals offered free international calls and taken back to the airport well rested and ready for that last 1 hour leg of travel the next morning. I was so impressed with their customer service.,1
I bought a ticket with Spirit Airlines due to their low price. However I didn't factor in the enormous amounts of extra fees that I'd be paying in the end which is my fault for not having thoroughly researched an airline. After purchasing my ticket we paid an extra $170 in fees. For a one way trip. $80 for two checked bags $20 in government fees (this is normally included in the ticket price I assumed). Then we had to pay for our seats for both the initial flight and the connecting flight so four more charges totalling $70. They have a random generated seating option which is free but then my fiancÃ© and I wouldn't have been sitting together for our vacation which I think is absurd. Overall the base fare is cheap but with the nickle and diming that they do afterwords you're better off finding a different flight. I would recommend JetBlue.,0
JFK-CMN. Delayed 2 hours aircraft was very old nothing worked correctly bathrooms not clean and the stewards did not care! If you asked for anything they would not provide it don't be surprised to hear things like we are on break!. They should act on this ASAP or lose customers.,0
Flew from VCE to FRA and from FRA to DUB economy class ticket. The crew on both flights were extremely polite and kind. On the VCE to FRA flight we had to wait in the aircraft for around 45 minutes due to problems with snow in Frankfurt. Some people were worried that they would miss their connecting flights but the crew and flight attendants kept us informed about all delays and changes. I got my flight to Dublin on time and it also had a slight delay. I have flown with Lufthansa most of my life and I am very satisfied with the airline. The food however is like with all other European and American airliners if you fly on an economy class ticket.,1
Having completed 4 long haul flights I found MH to offer good value for money all flights operated on time the food and wine was of an acceptable standard the entertainment has greatly improved especially on the A380 they need to upgrade the B777 to the A380 level. Cabin crew were excellent. We travelled MH003/11 Feb LHR-KUL MH141/12 Feb KUL-SYD and MH130/16 Mar AKL-KUL MH004/18 Mar KUL-LHR. We took advantage of an upgrade offer on the AKL-KUL flight for a small fee We noted that the food service was poor for business class eg only 1 dessert choice and no cheese selection.,1
SAP-BZE-FRS. I had two flights with this regional airline this past month! Ssmall grand caravan planes but both clean and spotless! flights on time crew friendly! Due to the size of the aircraft there's no FA on board. Price paid fair I do recommend if you're flying to Belize.,0
Johannesburg-Frankfurt. Excellent flight albeit economy on A380 and there was ample space for stowing hand luggage. Staff efficient and very friendly to start off a drink and some pretzels then dinner service (chicken or pasta) with drinks again coffee and liquor breakfast included scrambled eggs. Seat comfort not bad considering it was economy entertainment worked fine with big selection of movies. All in all a very good experience.,1
ORD-DUB-ORD. Great service both during the check-in process and onboard on both flights. Very good IFE and decent food. The fact that you have to pay for alcohol is a bit annoying but it is becoming the standard in the industry. Clearing customs in Dublin is a great plus. Overall a very good experience.,1
Flew from Narita/Tokyo to Copenhagen. The aircraft was old and everything was outdated. Blankets are filthy (lot of hair on the blanket) and entertainment screen resolution is horrible.. I didn't know it still exists but SAS entertainment isn't on-demand so you hope for the best and catch a movie that has just started. For a long haul like Asia-Europe (11.5 hours) it's just unbelievable. Cabin crews didn't even check who ordered special meals and they handed over meals to the wrong people. You have to pay for alcohol beverages (not that I care but again it is an intercontinental flight!) and each meal is very minimal. I compare SAS to other European airlines that operate between Asia and Europe and I definitely think SAS tickets are overpriced. Although Finnair isn't the best their flights are shorter and service is better and there isn't much difference in price.,0
TXL-CGN. On time flight and straightforward check-in. Very good value for money. Assigned and comfortable leather seat. Clearly stands out amongst the low-budget carriers.,1
"Barcelona - Amsterdam - (supposed to be Dulles/IAD) - Minneapolis - Dulles. The check in and baggage check in at Barcelona airport was total chaos. The lines were mixed the self-serve kiosks were moody and the staff was pretty cold. Flight to Amsterdam was fine. Got through gate security in Amsterdam 10 minutes from boarding and they moved our gate. Five minutes at the new gate and they cancelled our flight. KLM had given our plane to another flight and cancelled our flight due to ""mechanical issues"". We were told to sprint down to a transfer desk where they held us in a queue with ""no information"" for about an hour. During this time they were already re-booking people who had access to the lounges. They slowly filtered us through the transfer desk by handing out ""now serving"" numbers. It was another hour before we made it to the desk and were told we were being rebooked on Delta through Minneapolis boarding now at a distant gate. Only one of our bags arrived in Minneapolis. We were told the others would meet us in Dulles. Had to stand in line at the lost baggage desk in Dulles for another hour 12 hours after we were supposed to have been in originally. The Delta staff were very helpful but we were told that the bags had never reached them so it was KLM's issue. When we contacted KLM they originally said it wasn't their problem contact Delta. The bags arrived 24 hours later having never left Amsterdam in the first place. This is the second time I have been stranded by KLM in Amsterdam. I was hoping their service had improved in 10 years but unfortunately I was mistaken.",0
One way Barcelona to Gatwick. The seats are comfortable the crew pleasant but someone needs to tell them that it is unpleasant to line up passengers twenty minutes before boarding and walk up and down the line while barking orders about having your passport open at the photo page.,1
"LHR-MLE-COL. Terrible outward flight on a very old A320. Really narrow seats with no leg room as there was a kind of solid metallic box under the seat in front no foot rest upholstery on seats lumpy and uncomfortable. The seat in front of my husband could not be properly adjusted to upright IFE did not work and anyway unwatchable as the picture was awful. To add insult to injury the food was inedible and cold and we were only offered one tiny glass of wine. We often fly Economy and know that one cannot expect too many frills but this gives a whole new meaning to the expression ""cattle class"". The return flight on 27th Feb in an A340 marginally better in that the seats were no quite so beaten up but all other comments apply.",0
Recently travelled from Brisbane to Launceston and over the past 4 months I have made many return trips due to my moving. The flight times are very convenient and all but one flight was on time with departure and sometimes early on arrival. One flight was 25 minutes late due to weather which is of no consequence. All aircraft's were clean and cabin crew were fine. Several times I had emergency exit seats offered which I accepted and have no complaint with my treatment. I don't usually purchase food as I am sure I can survive for 2.5 hrs. The fares were all cheap easy to book and are good value. As always you get what you pay for. I rarely take luggage so the fare structure suits me and I always pay via Direct Debit to save on Credit Card Fees. One of my return trips via Melbourne was actually with Parent Company Qantas and this flight was nowhere near as pleasant as the Jetstar flights. Its just a shame that I see poor behaviour on these flights from fellow passengers over fairly minor problems.,1
BNE-MEL-BNE. Outbound delayed 2hrs with no explanation and then flight boarding never called - lucky I was near the gate and followed everyone else! Onboard service was passable crew friendly. Return flight - loaded us on and then technical issue saw us unloaded and transferred to another flight (via security- again!) total delay 2.5hrs. Total cost of my time 4.5hrs. add this to the regular flight times to and from and needing to be there at least a hr prior to check in = 10.5hrs. Qantas next time where I don't need to spend a day of my life just to get to MEL and back.,0
Tashkent-Urgench-Tashkent. Staff try to get your money for everything even if most of them knows me personally after 5 years of same destination - extra baggage better seat etc. When you want to reserve a seat mostly you'll get a negative answer first. They will tell you that flight is full. What they do is reserve some seats for artificial names. That way the flight seems full when you attempt a reservation. If you pay an under-the-counter fee she will change the name on the reservation on your name and you got your seat. Same during check-in : they will ask you to put your hand bag/computer/whatever on to the scale. If you are somehow +20 they will start to make faces and convince you that it will be too expensive if you pay official fee. They will ask you to pay half of the money that you'll pay officially directly to check in staff. I don't do that now as the official fee is also is not that much. I simply ask them to write the extra weight which I check each time and go to pay to the counter. The officer in the counter is also surprised as this is not very common. If you'll ask for a specific seat they will make you understand that it is available against a small tip (2-3 USD). Don't as usually no one sits in accordance with the assigned seats and it is almost impossible to convince the person who have sit to your place to move. In the past you might also tip (20-50 USD) in the cabin and ask for a Business Class seat but I do not know if this is still possible.,0
Flight from Cologne to Santorini was very nice. The seats were comfortable with good pitch friendly crew clean plane and the buy on board sandwiches were tasty and reasonably priced.,1
Economy Singapore-Bangkok TG408. Flight slightly delayed and I got bitten by the Changi Airport habit of misinforming people of the start of boarding. Boarding started 30 minutes later than the flashing signs indicated. Boarding was a little bit chaotic and started before an announcement was made. As a Star Alliance Gold member I like being able to board earlier than other passengers. Got a choice of newspapers. Luckily headphones were handed out during the long wait for departure and the entertainment system worked the whole time during landing and take-off. We got the choice between fish-rice and chicken-noodles. I went with the noodles. Easily the best dish I've eaten on a flight (business or economy). A simple dish yes but excellent executed. Service was good with the only remark that the second offering of drinks came from behind and took me and other passengers by surprise. The stewardess was apparently in a hurry. If you ask people if they want another drink please wait for an answer and try not to break the 100m sprint record. But this was the only remark for an otherwise very pleasant flight. Seat comfort was OK (I am 1m 81 tall).,1
Poor trip with Jetstar will be happy if I never travel with them again. Our direct flight was cancelled Sydney to Phuket and we were then sent through Sydney-Melbourne-Phuket meaning an extra few hours before we even left Australia. Once on board our Melbourne Phuket plane the seats were quite comfortable. Meal times were different we had paid and pre-ordered meals but no they had no record of that even though it was printed on our ticket. This meant we had no meals as only those prepaid and recorded were put on board. We could then purchase a toasted sandwich or pie most uninteresting and unsatisfying. The staff were less than helpful daughter had an infant and was not offered a spare cushion or any other help.,0
HKG-Phuket return. OX is not that bad as what we thought! Both flights on schedule. Of course you get what you pay for. The aircraft are old and food & service is average. All in all we were satisfied with the flights!,0
Myself and my wife along with a 3 year old we took a flight from Toronto - Vancouver. Staff were very rude at check-in at the boarding gate as well as on the flight itself. I requested a pillow and a blanket for my son who was very sleepy as we had transited from UK the air crew rudely said to me that we have to pay for it I didn't mind paying but it is something unheard of. I travel so often but never asked to pay for these things even in the cheapest airlines in Europe like Ryanair EasyJet etc. I will never recommend Air Canada to anyone and will never fly with them again in the future. This doesn't seem like a star alliance to me. Worst by all means.,0
Mumbai to Mangalore 5th Dec 2013 12.30 pm. We never had any problems with baggage they allowed 2 check in bags for each passenger approx 30 kg/passenger. Airport personnel were pleasant even inflight service was nice. Right on time. Aircraft's are new.,1
LGW-SZG in business class. Not sure what the point is with the new reduced legroom Club Europe seats. OK breakfast but was able to get breakfast in the lounge beforehand anyway. Only reason for going CE was because only Â£30 more than flexible economy ticket. If there was a big difference I wouldn't bother. Flight was on time.,1
Excellent flights to and from Prestwick to Palma. On time quick check in at Palma - stick to rules and no problems ever. Its the people who are the problem - 5 flights in 3years never a problem.,1
"BKK-LPQ on ATR72. Scheduled depart time of 9.15 pushed back in 30-min increments until eventual departure at 13.30. Excuse given was ""weather at LPQ"" but was clearly a lie since other services into LPQ were running to schedule. Gate staff at BKK clearly stressed. At boarding a carload of VIP pax turned up boarded before all other pax so suspect that was the real reason. At least a full lunch service was catered.",0
Staff not friendly and not dedicated on 4 flights. Cancelled flight without an explanation or apologizing (and when you travel for more than 24 hours with unfriendly crew you get irritated). Clearly there was small number of people on cancelled flight so they decided to spread us in other flights. Not enough food no towels or wet wipes for hands. Not enough water served. Not very comfortable seats - entertainment poor.,0
Singapore to Amsterdam (via Helsinki). While the plane was comfortable enough the inflight entertainment was quite limited and dated amazingly compared to Jetstar even! For a long haul flight however the food was almost indelible. Dinner was no choice some bland rice and meat dish. The most hilarious was breakfast though some kind of instant quiche soggy potato chips (for breakfast) soggy green beans and a sausage. I was quite amazed. I've lived in Finland and know food is not their forte but wow. Throughout the flight the attendants were quite brusque and when asked for a beer I was told that they're busy and a drinks cart will come eventually. When they did I was told that hardly any of the drinks on the menu where available. So I just stuck with water. The in Europe flight was much more inline with what I have experienced with Finnair good friendly service and basic tasty food. I won't be flying long haul with Finnair again rather pay a bit more for one of the Arab airlines and get good food and open bar.,0
I took a flight to London on 17th July with my 3.5 year old son and wife. Travelling with kids is not easy as they constantly require something to focus their attention to without which they can easily get irritable. We were hoping that the inflight entertainment system would provide ample entertainment to keep my son occupied. Unfortunately the entertainment system suffered technical problems throughout the journey from Doha to London and none of us were able to watch anything. Eventually it turned out to be a boring flight as well as a stressful one. What's more the pilot did not even acknowledge that there was a problem as he should have at least apologized to all the passengers with regards to this shortcoming.,1
EWR-TLV economy B777-200. The cheapest flight on this route. Check-in was fast but boarding was slow and the security officer rude and pointless. Plane left 45 mins late but arrived on time. Seat was comfortable with enough space. Food was delicious especially the breakfast. The entertainment was not as extensive as other Asian carriers. Flight attendants were responsive and present in the cabin during this long flight.,1
We flew to Barbados on 4th December from Manchester had booked premium economy for both flights. Unfortunately on arriving at 7.30 to book in we were informed the plane had been changed due to 'operational' problems so no premium economy available also the flight was delayed and would not be leaving until 1 15pm we eventually departed at 2 15! Vouchers for Â£6 were given to all passengers to either spend on board or in airport for refreshments. The return journey leaving at 6 30pm was excellent and we sat in the premium economy seats we had selected meals on both flights were excellent. Special mention must be given to the flight crews on both journeys they were extremely helpful polite and though obviously tired on the outward journey remained happy and extremely professional in their roles.,1
BEG-VIE-LHR. First leg uneventful. Nice new A320 adequate catering and service for one hour flight. Ground services in VIE were something different. Following 10 min delay due to ?surprise??of plane landing early I made a swift move to the gate at the opposite side of the airport only to be met by queue in standstill. There were three OS staff evidently dealing with some queries dozens of people with their boarding tickets in hand and two separate OS members of staff checking visas at very slow pace. This was the most shambolic boarding I have witnessed. There were no announcements about cause for the delay no apology and 45 mins later we boarded the plane via shuttle bus. The staff on B738 were obviously annoyed about the delay which influenced their very swift and somewhat rude service only to be kept on hold for 40 mins in holding pattern above London.,0
Fifth trip with Oman this year. As I noted previously there has been a decline in service but not so bad as we wouldn't fly with them again. Airline food is never great and these flights were no different. The Muscat to Heathrow leg was almost 9 hours thanks to a head wind...it felt like forever. Attendants good and proactive with the cleaning of toilets. Will still fly Oman while they are much cheaper than competitors.,1
Very poor service. Flew from Kathmandu to Dubai. Even a glass of water had to be purchased. Lost a connecting flight to New York due to it's delay. Officials at Dubai airport don't take any complaints of the Dubai based airlines. Stranded in the airport for 24 hours. Very poor service of Fly Dubai.,0
Helsinki - London. Boarding in HEL very disorganised with our flight boarding and another arriving in the same tiny area at gate 11/12. With nearly 150 pax waiting to board at about 5 pax a minute being checked (there was just one very flustered woman checked boarding cards/visas etc) so boarding took a while. MD90 was old but ok to fly. Exit rows 24A/F have 64 inch seat pitch but are slightly narrower than normal seats. Free tea/coffee/water. Staff friendly. GBP 50 each way so great value.,1
The seats are definitely not geared for Western heights and weights. My husband was tortured with no legroom for 13 hours. It was just not comfortable. Might be ok under 5 hour flights but for long distance travel its brutal. The staff were accommodating. Food was pretty bad and I actually didn't know what some of the items that were served. I left a lot. Not sure I'd fly this airline again because of the cramped uncomfortable seating. That's really all they have to offer.,0
BRU-BOM on 9th of November. Pretty surprised of the high standards and professionalism of Jet Airways. Food was very tasteful well presented and plenty. On top of that we were served by an extremely friendly crew. Return flight DEL-BRU the 1st December was completely the opposite though. Before takeoff menus were distributed and you had to give your choice. I hardly had the chance to look at the menu when the rude stewardess said I had to make my choice. Once my choice made she grabbed the menu out of my hands and took it back. Food was the most terrible I ever had on a flight. The refreshment was tiny and extremely spicy and was served as good as cold. Breakfast even was worse with a few slices of tasteless unripe fruit smashed on a plate followed by a cold omelette and 2 hard cold greasy discs that were expected to be hash brown potatoes! Just as with the refreshment served earlier presentation was inexistent and looked like everything was just smashed on the plate. I told the stewardess this was the worst meal I ever had on a plane. She apologized and offered me cereals instead this was business class! The only positive point were the flat bed seats.,0
Astonishingly bad. Flew from Cardiff to Glasgow on Tuesday flight delayed by an hour went through boarding gate and all passengers then told the flight was cancelled and there were a few seats on the Edinburgh flight that they had delayed by an hour and a half. Service staff demonstrated no empathy and pointedly rude to stunned passengers. Arbitrary mechanism for selecting who to kick off the flight and no guarantee about who could travel the following day. Was due in at 9.40pm bus got to Glasgow airport at 1am and all passengers had to wait ages in the rain for few taxis. Return flight was delayed by an hour and three quarters. This airline is diabolical.,0
"Online seat selection was broken the day before our departure, we had purchased the ""premium"" package to select the seats in advance. In order to use this package I had to actually call them instead of doing it online. Unlike most airlines online check-in is available only 4 hours before departure. The online check-in process is the worst I have seen - you cannot check in everyone on your booking at the same time, you have to do it for each family member, even for children. At the airport it was not too bad, just like other budget airlines. The check-in line was long but that's where the premium package is useful. The flight from Montreal to Holguin was OK. The aircraft was relatively large but the seat spacing was extremely small. We are not talking about the centimeters between your knees and the seat in front of you, we are talking about the centimeters between your nose and that seat. If the passenger in front of you reclines, you simply have no choice but to recline too. If you go to the bathroom and they start serving food or drinks - you will not get back to your seat until the cart passes it. Food and drink service is ok. I have to admit that the food was provided and it it was quite good. The flight back (WG645) was terrible. First, the drink service was worse, they did not even have coffee. Next, the cabin temperature. It was very cold. Considering that the families were flying from Cuba (+35C) with kids it was just terrible. Many people complained but nothing was done to make it warmer. Next, the flight was late to Montreal by ~40 minutes, it could not get to the gate. Finally, instead of unloading the gate checked-in strollers they have unloaded them with the rest of the luggage. Lots of fun with small kids getting through 1-hour-plus waiting line at the border control and the customs.",0
SIN-SUB-SIN with Jetstar's ValueAir A320 on 2 and 5 Nov '13. Checked in at Changi and Juanda airports were quick since I didn't have any check-in luggage. Furthermore I arrived early so the queue wasn't long. Both flights departed slightly late but arrived on time. I bought neither the foods nor the drinks during the 2.15 hours of flight so I can't comment on that. The crews were ok. Information about the destination was given by the captain just before landing which is standard for any flight. To sum it up it was a quick hassle free flights.,1
AF76 to Papeete Tahiti on 10/7. Eight hour flight arrived at 5:10 AM. Required check-in in Los Angeles on transfer from Delta. No indication of location of Air France Counters outside of International Terminal. Sky Priority check-in very hectic so much that we just made it to the plane as they were boarding. Flight was okay except my traveling companion and I were separated in our seat assignments as were other travelers and the flight attendants managed to re-seat everyone except us - French speakers first.,1
Four flight segments all in Y-class two pax senior age. MIA-BOG and BOG-SCL. We picked them because of convenient departure times out of MIA and due to a considerable price difference compared to LAN Chile. All 4 flights - domestic and international - were in almost new Airbus A320 and A330 planes thus impressively clean. Departure procedures at MIA and BOG international airports were chaotic the domestic terminal in BOG plus the terminals in Cartagena and Santa Marta are acceptable. Inflight service is ok for the domestic part - the service on international flights is probably the worst we have ever experienced. The only thing they care about is selling onboard duty free items. If you want to save money take Avianca into consideration their planes will still be pretty new in 2012 - if you want/need more quality and service you have to pay the higher fares of LAN!,0
I flew back from Kuala Lumpur yesterday in business class. The seats are comfortable and the service onboard is great. The only bad point was the luggage we had to wait a long time to collected them after landing. As I was in Business I didn't think I would have to wait.,1
"MUC-IST-SSH-IST-MUC February/March 2015: Very good Service on the MUC-IST flight good IFE very good food and fresh Orange Juice friendly Staff. IST-SSH no IFE due to older plane flight back good as the others. In compare to other ""great"" Airlines a very good Service and I would recommend Turkish Airlines as well as Ataturk Airport!",1
"Flew Oakland-Terceira on Aug 5 2014 flight 236. Well aware of the cramped space in economy class I paid over 2K for an executive seat extra leg room and supposed extra comfort on an 11 hour flight. Instead this is what a two thousand dollar ""Executive Class?service you get from Oakland to Terceira: 1) The flight had a departure of Aug 4th but it was delayed 27 hours one vacation day lost! 2) My executive seat was not functioning! From Oakland to Toronto (approx. 5.5 hours) I was unable to recline my seat! 3) In Toronto they made minimal effort to repair the seat but to no avail. I did discover how to manually make my seat recline however the foot rest never fully opened up. 4) The meal from Oakland to Toronto was substandard at best however it was much better than the cold sandwich served us from Toronto to Terceira (approx. 5.5 hour flight). 5) In?Executive?we are supposed to have ??priority??luggage which supposedly means our luggage is to be unloaded first -?¦mine was unloaded 1.5 hours after landing. I was the last person to leave baggage claim in Terceira! Despite SATA touting preferred service for their SATA Plus customers those flying out of Oakland have very little preferred service! If this is the best SATA can do in their Executive class they have no right to charge 3x more for these seats! For the same money I could?have bought 3 seats in economy class had the same service and the same comfort as what I got in Executive.??The only positive aspect to my flight over was that I arrived safely.",0
HEL-SIN-HEL on A340 in June-July 2012. Haven't flown with them for 4 years because competitors have been cheaper on long haul. Flights packed to the last seat but both flights on time two hot meals served on this 11-12 hr flight pleasant and adequate service by a Finnish-Chinese-Malay cabin crew and the IFE worked well on both flights. However there is room for improvement on this 4-star airline: Meals from Helsinki Airport flight kitchen are bland and cheap quite the opposite on the SIN-HEL leg with tasty chicken or beef plus a proper hot breakfast IFE is too limited. A wider range of newer films are needed. No overnight pack (socks etc) which is a standard on many airlines. The price was right this time and we felt it was good value. Moreover their new uniforms are quite classy. When the price is right Finnair will be considered again although they are clearly behind many other 4-star airlines (LH TG TK etc.).,1
I flew Beirut - Istanbul ground check in was ok but a little bit crowded. Food was probably the best food you can eat in an airplane. Staff were friendly but not too friendly the seats were comfortable and entertainment was nice although I would recommend less out-dated music. I found a piece of chewed chewing gum stuck on the seat in front of me which proves no professional cleaning was done. Second staff barely speak English or any other language other than Turkish but they remain friendly although it wouldn't hurt to smile more would it? Last but not least Istanbul airport is a no-go it's dirty extremely crowded and has no free wifi!,0
Recently flew V Australia to Dublin (with Etihad from Abu Dhabi) in Premium Economy. I was surprised at the price very inexpensive compared to other premium options. Flew SYD to AUH in 777-300 nice cabin with access to two toilets pretty amazing for only 40 pax. The staff were exceptional possibly some of the best inflight staff I have experienced for some time. Could not do enough for you and were attentive for the whole 14 hours (was the same for return leg). The seat was particularly comfortable and was able to manage 8 hours sleep. The food was ok not as good as Qantas premium and the inflight entertainment was great good choice and a plus with the noise cancelling headphones. Overall would rate this product very highly and have no hesitation in flying with them again.,1
This was my first and last time with American Airlines. Booked with British Airways from Dublin to Orlando. Flight out was fine as it was with BA but return was with AA - as they are partners of BA I thought the service would be the same. How wrong I was - flight was 2.5 hours delayed which meant we missed our flight from Dublin to Glasgow. I had to pay Â£190 to rebook flights. We were only allowed 1 checked bag each but with BA we were allowed 2 each. The stewardesses only came round once with drinks service and you had to pay for spirits. Plane seemed old. No inflight entertainment system in the back of seat instead TVs that came down where everyone had to watch the same film. No leg room at all. Very narrow seats that were extremely uncomfortable. I never complain about anything and when I read the reviews before our flight I thought they were exaggerated but honestly it's the worst flight I have ever been on and I wouldn't fly with them again even if it was free.,0
"Scoot seems cheaper, but with all the inconveniences and add ons, it is actually close to the price of a full service airline. If you pay for a meal, it is atrocious even by airline standards. Basic things like check in from the city of origin to destination if you need a transfer in SIN are not included - there is a fee (marketed as Scoot-Thru) if you do not want to go through customs. I took two trips with them (one ?Business????read premium economy) and one economy, and have had surprises on both. The latest was not being able to check in online from Hong Kong. Atrociously inconvenient and indicative of shoddy service. Definitely an airline to be avoided.",0
"I was unhappy with the food. The quality was poor, and for an 11 hour flight there should have been two full meals. There was one meal and three minuscule snacks with water only. On the outward flight the service was excellent, but for the return it was probably the worse I have encountered.  I was disappointed and surprised that the Swiss are not always very professional.",0
Flew MEL-BKK on 777-300ER aircraft with full flat beds / direct aisle access for all seats. Excellent hard product with exceptional sleeping comfort and very nice cabin ambience. Food and beverage of a good standard. Good service at the airport and no delays.,1
"LAS-SFO-half empty plane on a Tuesday. Loved the leather seats 32"" seat pitch was okay because seats are thin and comfy. Lighting was cool. FAs friendly and not seeming bored serving in the back of the plane.",1
LHR-SIN - return. Another great flight with Singapore Airlines on A380. The crew were all friendly and served drinks throughout the flight. My vegetarian special meals were tasty - one of the best I have had. Good choice of programs on TV.,1
"My husband and I recently flew to Grand Cayman to visit our daughter. We flew with Qantas from Brisbane to Los Angeles before travelling on to Cayman then returned with Qantas from Los Angeles. We have travelled extensively in recent years but due to poor experience with Qantas over 25 years ago had not used Qantas since then. We were very impressed with Qantas on our recent journeys. The staff were professional relaxed and very accommodating not only to us but to passengers around us. The cabin was clean well equipped with blankets etc for our long trip. The entertainment devices worked well. Most of all I felt the little extra touches made the trip more comfortable - bottles of water without needing to request water extra snacks in case of ""the munchies"" during the night or other than mealtimes. The standard of food was well above any of the many airlines which we have used in recent years. Overall Qantas made us feel very proud of ""our airline"".",1
I booked a trip with Spirit because of the price and then read the reviews and was very scared. I couldn't have been more happily surprised! Our trip was completely excellent. The stewardesses were very professional. There was an inflight medical issue and they were fantastic. We were on time both ways in fact slightly early. No glitches anywhere. The seats were not small - we had better seats than previously on American they did recline and the headrests folded to where you could nap. We flew for less than half of other airlines including the cost for our bags. If you know going in that it's going to cost $25 for a carry on at the time of booking do it then! If you wait until check-in it's $35 and if you wait until you get to the airport surprise! - it's now $100. Pack light and you will know ahead of time that there are no complimentary snacks or drinks. We will fly with them again.,1
